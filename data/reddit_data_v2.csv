"i‚Äôm not my mothers baby anymore","I 22f live at home with my mother 56f, i have health issues (physical and mental) and have not had a proper job in my life. i have worked at pubs since i was 18 but due to my illnesses i always have to cut my time short and leave. i do still pay my way with the benefits, though it‚Äôs not a lot the agreement we came up with was 15% of whatever i make that month 

she‚Äôs constantly in my business, and i love her but she‚Äôs very passive aggressive about it all. for context of how bad it is, i used to be big when i was about 14-18 and she would go through the trash to see what i had eaten that day. ( point to mention that when my brother lived with us he would eat everything and blame it on me because of my weight and she would believe him every time, to the point where she would hide food from me. she was a boy mom and not in a good way but that‚Äôs whole other story) i developed a restrictive ed and am thankfully in recovery but now she‚Äôs started doing the same thing. i have gained weight, but its healthy weight and im no where near as big as i was before

when i worked at the pub, my ed was destroying my life. i also gained a problem with alcohol and would have frequent autistic meltdowns. i had to leave, but she didn‚Äôt like that. i explained it to her and she told me that ‚Äúit was my future i was ruining‚Äù and that i should‚Äôve found another job first. i‚Äôm not against that idea and i do agree that it would‚Äôve been more ideal, but i was struggling so badly that it felt like i had no choice for my sanity just to leave

i‚Äôm currently doing two courses on SEND education and autism on its own. because of my issues (i‚Äôm autistic, have anxiety, in recov for anorexia and have adenomyosis. i really struggled with school and education) she has always been reluctant but supportive whenever i‚Äôve made a decision to go back to college as i think she wants me to do well for myself but doesn‚Äôt believe that i am able to do it. i think that she thinks im lazy. on top of college, i volunteer at a primary school near by where both of my nephews attend. i volunteered at the primary school before taking on my college courses, but ive found that i need to prioritise college in this situation. i feel guilty as i love the kids in the school and this week will be the last week before the summer holidays but these college courses are like a crash course. they‚Äôre both 1 session a week for 11 weeks at a time which means that the whole course is relying on you having time at home to get the work you need done because of how short they are. 

in my head it is not beneficial for me to just volunteer at a school in hopes that they would offer me a job, though it‚Äôs great to have experience, i need to get my qualifications more than anything right now. by the time the kids go back in september, i will only be doing one course and have more time for the school. my mum thinks this is a bad idea, but i don‚Äôt know how to explain to her that im 22. i‚Äôm not her baby anymore, im a fully grown adult who can make my own adult choices regarding my future. i‚Äôm trying to do this to gain independence and she‚Äôs constantly making passive aggressive comments like ‚Äúdo whatever you want it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll listen to me anyway‚Äù. 

i feel suffocated and guilty all of the time and i don‚Äôt know what to do.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m4zcrm/im_not_my_mothers_baby_anymore/","1753043705.0","Adulting","cinamorollulu"

"Mother","I wonder how my mother thinks of me. Probably differently than my sister. My mother never really talked to me with kind eyes and maybe because of me. I don't know what changed us. There is a gap between us that we cannot fill. I love her and maybe she loves me back too. Can I say controlling and over protection are a part of love? 

Will she ever feel better if I leave or will she be hurt? There are questions that I want to ask but too afraid. My mother never tried to understand me and I don't blame her, I don't understand myself at times. But what about the feelings I carry. 

She cares about everyone and everything as I observed her. Her tone changes when she talks to me. She says she never had a bias but she lies everytime. I feel uncomfortable, unhappy, scared, my fight or flight mode gets activated somehow and it's around her, or when she comes toward me.

"Should I commute or dorm in college?","Not this comming year, but the year after I will be in college, I have chosen to go to a local state school about 20 to 25 minutes from my house. I need to decide if I should dorm or commute.

Reasons to commute:

1. it would be cheaper. I will most likely get a full ride to the college, but that only covers tuition. The dorm would be about between $3,370 and $5,890 per semester depending on the housing chosen. I would have to pay anything that scholarships and grants out of pocket and I dont want student debt. 

2. I am already comfortable at home and I would have pets and a safe spot. Also because of my autism, if I get overstimulated while dorming i dont know if I'll have a safe spot or not. I also won't have to worry about getting along with a roommate and it might be easier to do my therapy sessions. I also think that by dorming I'll be more exposed to things that overstimulated and upset me.

3. I don't know if I'll be able to make friends. I hear that dorming is great if you have friends, but I haven't made any ""friend"" since middle school and that turned out horribly. I have no problem talking to people, I just have a lot of trouble trusting them enough to ask to hang out and stuff that friends do. I dont think I'll like dorming without friends.

Reasons to dorm:

1. I would learn how to function in society. I would have to remember when to do things which would help me for the future, expesually that after college I plan on moving to another country that does not speak English (Japan), so yeah independence might be a kinda useful skill for me to improve at.

2. Some people are able to make friends while dorming. My older sibling is in college and dorms. They have made lots of friends, and they are more quiet than me. They also found a significant other to. I see my sibling hanging out with their friends from college and I want a friend to.

3. I would get more freedom. My sibling, who is 19 still has to ask mom to do stuff when they are at home, but when they are at college they can do whatever they want and mom can't do anything. So if I commute, I will likely have to get permission to do anything or go anywhere even though I would be an adult. I would also have to keep following my mom's rules and I would have to still do things I dont like when im told, like shaving my legs if I commute. I wouldn't have to worry about doing or not doing what Mom says as much if I dorm though. But I might make bad decisions and ruin everything too so... I dont know if this is a good or bad thing.

4. The major that I will do (elementary education) has whole dorms with living learning centers in the college. I dont know exactly how it works, but I think you can choose to live with other education majors and have classes or do activities on education stuff right in the dorm or something. I do think that commuting education majors still have access to this though.

5. It would be more convenient. If I were to commute, my mom would have to drive me because their is only 1 car. And I really dont want to get my own car to drive myself because 1. I can't afford it and 2. I hopefully will be on the other side of the world after college so it's not worth it. My mom is more than willing to provide transportation, but I would have to work around her schedule since their is only 1 car.

I have time to think about it, since I still have to do senior year, but I need to start thinking about dorming or commuting since I know what college I'm going to, my major, and what I want to do after college (plus a plan b if that doesn't work out) I just have the dorming/commuting thing left. I think my main concern is the cost because I know that I'll have to pay back any student loans I get on my own and paying off student debt is hard and it is not a good idea to go to Japan as an ALT (assistant language teacher) with American student debt because student debt is a lot more in America than it is in Japan (Japan just has a lower cost of living overall which also means lower pay) and the yen is weak to the usd.

Do you think I'll be better off commuting or dorming? Both are doable for me i think. Feel free to ask any questions below.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m53eeh/should_i_commute_or_dorm_in_college/","1753054121.0","college","Desperate_Sector7326"
"Why do I feel so frustrated about sex?","I'm a 32-year-old man, and I recently moved to a small town in the U.S. I‚Äôd really love to connect with and date women here. But this brings up a deep frustration and anger that I‚Äôve carried for years when it comes to relationships with women‚Äîespecially intimate ones.

I take care of my appearance, and both friends and several women have told me I'm attractive. And yet, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend or been in a ‚Äúrelationship.‚Äù I‚Äôve only had two sexual encounters, but they were neither enjoyable nor satisfying because of the intense anxiety that has consumed my mind since adolescence.

Because of this, over the past 3 or 4 years, I‚Äôve reached a point where I spend most of my days feeling sad, worried, frustrated, and full of self-hatred for not having figured this out at my age. What keeps my mind trapped is FEAR. That fear of intimacy and seduction just won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm still incredibly shy and anxious when talking to women (and people in general), which makes it almost impossible for me to connect with someone on a deeper level. Honestly, after thinking about this for so long, I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs just social and sexual anxiety, or if it‚Äôs a deeper emotional block. (I should mention that I was heavily bullied as a kid, and I suspect that‚Äôs played a role in my difficulty approaching women.)

It feels like I never developed ‚Äúemotional maturity‚Äù in this area. Since most people go through their first relationships and sexual experiences during their teenage years, and that didn‚Äôt happen for me, I feel stuck. Social media makes everything worse because we're constantly bombarded with hypersexualized content, and I can‚Äôt escape that overwhelming pressure. It leaves me feeling frustrated and powerless as a man‚Äîas if I‚Äôm failing at something that‚Äôs supposed to come naturally. And the more time goes by, the harder it gets. The fear only grows stronger, and obviously, I can‚Äôt just tell a woman that I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend or dating experience, because by this age, most women already have a lot of experience just by virtue of being women.

I want to be clear that I‚Äôve seen many psychologists and psychiatrists since I was 17. I‚Äôve tried every antidepressant and medication I‚Äôve been prescribed, but NOTHING has worked. The worst part is that this isn‚Äôt something I can talk about openly with just anyone. Therapists don‚Äôt seem to know how to properly address sexual anxiety‚Äîthey just tell me: ‚ÄúGo out and talk to women,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not that simple. Approaching someone and forming a connection that leads to intimacy takes much more than just talking.

I‚Äôm considering seeing a sex therapist or trying some kind of sexual therapy, but honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to hear the typical advice like ‚Äújust pay a prostitute,‚Äù because that‚Äôs not what I truly want. I‚Äôve had Tinder for years, and even though I get quite a few matches, nothing ever happens. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to meet anyone in person for all the reasons I‚Äôve mentioned. I regularly hang out with friends, and they‚Äôve tried giving me advice and even introducing me to women, but I always end up avoiding the situation. Just thinking about going on a date with no experience makes me feel absolutely terrible.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you!","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m53gn1/why_do_i_feel_so_frustrated_about_sex/","1753054285.0","Adulting","Titus4266"

"Am I doing enough to get my degree.?","I‚Äôm in my early 20s, I‚Äôm doing part time community college due to early life during high school of being an idiot, but also financially not able to afford living in campus. 

I always grew up being last, I had a IEP in my childhood and abused it later on to be lazy and not learn, during my early high school years I always got people to laugh and make friends, I was a comedian to the class I was a known person in some ways, I guess it was my fitting in dream, during that time I was academically doing horribly, D in algebra and nearly a F in gym, only good grade I got was in history, later on in high school I locked in, I actually improved my GPA to a 3.4 but also decided to major in education after being inspired by a teacher, history was the only good thing I was good in, I actually had fun in. 

I decided to do community college, my SAT was shit, my income was lacking and i didn‚Äôt wanna be a burden on anyone but myself. My first semester was a fucking laughing stock. I took one class, and nearly failed, i had zero clue how to write a research paper to anything else, however it didn‚Äôt stop me, I grew from that frustration and started trying to understand it, I only got D‚Äôs in two other classes math and science however ever since then I gotten As or Bs, I could write 8 paper research papers like it was nothing in philosophy to political science. 

However I been working nonstop just to afford college, I could only take two classes to successfully pass with good grades but also not be too expensive. I‚Äôm nearly my transfer date and god damn NJ isn‚Äôt helping at all with these tuition costs, I‚Äôm stuck researching how much each credit costs, what classes transfer and not, it‚Äôs been a god damn roller coaster.

Meanwhile I see fellow peers graduating and getting a start in their adult life, I started realizing that I‚Äôm being left behind honestly, it frustrates me, not only that but I‚Äôm lacking any college friends. I talked to no one really I‚Äôm constantly working during the afternoons till night and I take classes early morning.

I won‚Äôt have massive debt like everyone else but how the fuck do I afford transferring over, how can I finish faster.

"What do Australians think about thisÔºü","I‚Äòm a junior student planning to go to Australia.(99% going to Australia in the future) Frankly, I'm worried.(very) Australian universities have a terrible (you heard me right, terrible) reputation in China because a lot of  Chinese students simply buy their way through everything. It's downright ridiculous that some students managed to graduate without knowing how to speak English.

Now i 'm not saying that Australian universities are terrible, I just don't find the idea of using international students as cash cows comfortable. I know that the schools are worth attending, but i'm just worried. I've even heard rumors that some classes are taught in Chinese !!!!

I was originally planning to go to the u.s but my dad changed my mind. He said it would be nice if our family could live in the same country in the future, and since my brother studied in Sydney, he figured that i would go to Australia for college as well. (He loves Australia, saying that Australians have the highest resource/person rate, he also praises the welfare that Australians get, and also the scenery, and this, and that.........so on)

It's absolutely crazy that near half the students in the university of Sydney are international students.

"ending with two C's for my first college classes","i am so disappointed in myself and i hate myself. i was in community college for 4 years and had up and downs with my gpa due to working and struggling with health issues. one of the most reassuring things about transferring is that the gpa calculation is seperate at institutions, so my gpa 'starts over' at my university of transfer. (although for grad admissions they are combined) 

this summer i took two classes (online) for my majors and i will be ending with a 75 in both of them and i am just so disappointed. i was barely hanging on but last week my cat suddenly and tragically passed, and i missed big assignments for both classes. i just recalcuated both grades and thought that for one class i'll take it pass/no pass but the other class i would end with an A. i thought that other class had more assignments and i can't take it pass/no pass because it's a major requirement and not a major elective. 

i'm just so angry with myself. theres nothing i can do to ask because i already haven't been a good student in this class. i could take it pass/no pass and retake the major requirement class but i had to spend 3000 dollars out of pocket for the summer session so it would just be a huge waste of money. i could withdraw but again, huge awaste of money with no refund.

"Working at a casino","Hello, I‚Äôm wanting to know what your opinion is on this. 

My mom started a new job exactly a month ago, as a cage cashier at a casino. She was trained for 1 week. Her second week she made an honest mistake which was her fault (a cash advance for $1000 but typed in $100 and was short $900). She has to pay this back by the casino taking out $250 from every paycheck. 

Last week she turned her back and noticed another worker swapping money out of her till. My mom asked the girl what she was doing, and not to do that since she‚Äôs responsible for the 200k that‚Äôs in there. This started an argument with the girl, essentially the girl calling my mom racist. (Which she‚Äôs never been. If she took the time to get to know my mom she would know that me, and all her kids are mixed and biracial). 

Well fast forward to last night, she worked with a new manager. I guess the manager counts their till again after the shift. The manager typed in something wrong. This manager texted my mom ‚Äúyou cannot come back to work until you pay $300‚Äù. My mom lives paycheck to paycheck. Of course she‚Äôs already stressed. She was literally crying over this. Another manager calls my mom the morning after and says ‚Äúthis was a managers mistake. You don‚Äôt owe $300 but you will be pointed, and can come into work‚Äù my mom responded ‚Äúpointed for what? If you‚Äôre pointing me I might as well stay home‚Äù. In which she did lol 

I‚Äôm already helping her find a new job. This is ridiculous and I can‚Äôt even imagine having to pay back for mistakes. I work at a bank and we have never had to pay anything to be able to work. This isn‚Äôt the club!! Lmao.

"is UNC worth applying to as an out-of-state student?","hi, i‚Äôm a rising senior trying to finalize my college list! i was looking at unc as a high reach school, and had the opportunity to tour it last year; i loved the campus, but i recently learned that its out of state admissions pool is far more competitive than i realized (yes, i put off researching schools quite a bit).

i obviously assumed it‚Äôd be considerably lower than the acceptance rate on google, but i didn‚Äôt realize it had a quota system like my state school (UT austin) does, so over 80% of its students are in-state and its oos acceptance rate is like 7%. i was comparing it to the threshold i had in my mind of UC's, which differ by like 1-2 percent for in vs out of state.

this makes it pretty much the most competitive school i have on my list by far, and i‚Äôm wondering if it would even be worth applying as a pre-law (econ or policy + socsci) major in such a competitive and saturated applicant pool. i have a decent profile but nothing t20 level (3.99 uw, about 17 ap‚Äôs, 1570 sat, not great awards, okay ec‚Äôs including research and npo stuff). finances aren‚Äôt really a concern in this situation either. 

i‚Äôm also worried i won‚Äôt even have enough reaches if i take unc off, i only have like 9 and i see everyone on this website shotgunning all the t20‚Äôs. i‚Äôd appreciate any help or insights from out of state kids at state schools.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m59gn3/is_unc_worth_applying_to_as_an_outofstate_student/","1753072059.0","ApplyingToCollege","underthetrees13"
"Is it silly to want to move out of state because I hate my job?","I (25F) started a new job back in February and for all intents and purposes I love what I do and I love most of my coworkers. Best part is getting to meet new people! It's a small business so there's only 10 of us, and I'm the only other person who's on the sales team besides my boss and he's been putting a lot of pressure on me to be closing sales, working on our website, posting on social media and it's exhausting (not to mention a lot of roles to take on)! 

Now, the title is slight hyperbole, I don't entirely hate it, just more so anxious from all the goals and getting burnt out. And my current job is in a field that I've studied (graphic design and print), so the idea of trying to find another job in the same field that pays just as well or better is not exactly ideal. 

However, it keeps crossing my mind. Not only do I want a fresh start, but I just can't see myself staying in this place forever, so why not go all out and just leave my state entirely. I'm from the Bay Area in CA, and I've been eyeing Chicago for quite some time. My career is not the only reason I want to move out, but it is a big part of it for sure. And I'm the kind of person to be pretty rational about things and think things through meticulously (I'm a big ""make a list of everything, pros and cons""). I'm not spontaneous when it comes to big decisions like this at all. I just want a second opinion on if my strong emotions on this are just heightened because of the stress or if it's a totally normal feeling to want to get out üò≠.

I kinda have an idea on the answer already but it would be nice to hear from other people if they've experienced this feeling before too.

Kahit ganyan kita ng mama ko hindi ako nang hingi or nag ask ng tulong na bumili naman siya minsan ng bigas or ulam kasi kulang pa yang kita niya sa mga utang niya. 

A little bit of background, last year lang. na scam si mama kasi mag gold daw sa lupain namin. Confirmed by the detector. Unfortunately, gumasta na siya ng more than 300K tapos walang nahukay. Yung 300K worth yun ng mga alahas niya lahat na sinangla niya. Ngayon, hindi ko siya ma help kasi marami rin akong utang. 

Now, may lupain kami na 1 hectare. At wala namang naiipasok na pera sa pamilya. Ilang beses ko na siya kinausap na mag benta nalang kami ng lupa para matapos na mga utang niya and pati na rin mga utang ko. Pero ayaw niya baka kasi daw totoo yung treasure tapos maling lokasyon lang yung nahukay namin. Baka daw mabinta namin tapos mahukay nung naka bili.

"I 20F think my partner 20M is going through an existential crisis","Hi. I‚Äôm in a relationship with someone who has avoidant tendencies. We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and we‚Äôve just entered our 20s. In the past, whenever he got overwhelmed, he would shut down or pull away without communicating, which almost led to breakups. But recently, we had a serious talk, and he admitted that leaving when things get hard isn‚Äôt a healthy way to cope, and he said he wants to grow from that.

Lately, though,I‚Äôve been sensing that he‚Äôs becoming distant again. Both of us have been extremely busy (I‚Äôm a med student), so we rarely get to talk or see each other. I also admitted that I haven‚Äôt been giving our relationship much attention lately because of my hectic schedule.

Last week, we finally got to see each other, even if just for a short time. We weren‚Äôt as affectionate as we used to be, but out of nowhere, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have motivation for anything lately.‚Äù When I asked why, he said he didn‚Äôt know. I told him I appreciated that he opened up, since that‚Äôs something he rarely does.

"Core GPA and Cumulative GPA","Hi, I am a rising senior in high school and have some questions about core and cumulative GPA.  
I currently have a mid-range cumulative GPA with a strong upward trend, so I thought I would be fine. However, when I recalculated it using ChatGPT, I found out that my core GPA was lower than 3.5, which surprised me.  
I think this is mainly because I got a D and a C in history classes (I‚Äôm not good at history), and most of my electives and advanced courses were non-core classes. Since my school doesn't offer AP or IB courses, I chose to focus on dual enrollment classes and electives related to my interests, such as business, microeconomics, and management.  
In summary, my cumulative GPA better reflects me as a whole person, since I took many non-core classes to dive deeper into my interests, whereas my core GPA is lower.

I saw a post that colleges are mainly focusing on core GPA (which means I'm cooked). What should I do now?

"I got bullied because my toilet stall door was kicked down","I was bullied while I was 13 and 14 during secondary school. (I live in England, so that‚Äôs high school for Americans)

 It all started at the beginning of the school year when I was minding my own business, taking a piss in a school toilet stall when all of a sudden I hear 3 girls storm in, screaming and creating a ruckus. Then my toilet stall door slams open, (while I am still sitting down on the freaking toilet) and undertandably, I panic. Luckily, my reflexes kick in and I manage to hold my hand out and close it. My heart was racing so fast. While that was happening, the girl who kicked down my door also kicked all the other stalls open, they continued laughing and then abruptly left. 

Now, I am still in the toilet stall, absolutely shook after all that. Of course, I didn‚Äôt want them to get away with what they just did so I quickly got out, washed up and went to look for a teacher. I found one, and luckily the girls were still there, but I didn‚Äôt know them, or which one kicked down the door. All I remember hearing was this one girl‚Äôs name constantly being shouted out, so I told him her name, what happened that then left. Somehow, that teacher knew those girls, especially the one I‚Äôd mentioned and immeadiately gave her a detention. (That detention was only about 10 minutes with the teacher, and they just talked about what she did wrong and why she shouldn‚Äôt do it again during that time) Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd just got myself into. 

As I mentioned, it was at the start of the year and my beautiful luck got me in classes without a single one of my friends with me.(I still hung out with throughout the school year, we just didnt share any classes together.) And on the first day of PE class, guess who was there? The girl I had snitched on, and she was pissed. (Bear in mind, before this point I had no idea who she was, and we‚Äôd never met before) Within this short amount of time, she‚Äôd told about 20 girls about me snitching on her, and now I had about 20 new people ready to start bullying me. It was hell. 

Everywhere I went I was met with this hostile atmosphere, and I coudn‚Äôt escape it, since all of my new classes had at least seven of these girls in them. I was regularly made fun of, and had to endure it in all of my classes except 3. I was only ever verbally abused, but it came really close to turning physical many times. 

During this time, my mental health worsened a lot, and I quickly became su1cidal. I cried every night and felt so unwanted. Worst thing? I didn‚Äôt even realise I was getting bullied. I only made that realisation one day after the only two friends I made said they‚Äôd told the teacher about me getting bullied, and that she needed to hear it from me first. I never ended telling her, as I didn‚Äôt want to believe that was what was going on.

As the school year went on, they only started being more violent until the summer holidays/ summer break rolled around. I was finally set free, but at what cost? My mental state was so degraded from all the bullying, I hated myself and honestly just wanted to die. I cried every night during that time, and even when I was finally away from it all, I couldn‚Äôt let go. I was quite depressed, and just shut myself off from everyone. It was a really hard time. Even now, looking back on it I regret cutting off my family members, but I‚Äôm always conflicted as I understand I just needed time. 

It all came to a sort of end the next year, but not without a ‚Äúbang‚Äù. I was finally back in classes with my friends, but not with my good friends who helped me get through the tough times the previous year anymore.

 I was sitting in the new class for a useless subject called PSHE (Personal,Social,Health,Education or basically a free period minus the freedom) when the teacher started assigning seats, and I was sat next to a girl. 5 minutes after the seat assignment, she tells the teacher ‚Äú Can I move, I can‚Äôt sit next to her because she had a problem with my mate in y9‚Äù. My heart drops. I‚Äôve never seen this girl in my entire life, she doesnt even know as much as my name, and she says doesn‚Äôt like me. This was like the breaking point for me, and I don‚Äôt know why I did it, but my mental state was so degraded I asked her ‚ÄúWhy do you hate me?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt say anything. Then I said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to hate me, you can just dislike me or something‚Äù She replied ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt control what people think of others, you don‚Äôt have the right‚Äù I just sat there in silence and cried. 

Later on, my friends would start to become close to this girl, I didn‚Äôt want them to even interact with her,as she supported the girls who bullied me, but I held back. I realised that if I said something, I would be helping estrange someone, and I didn‚Äôt want someone else to experience what I had in even the slightest way. Because of that, I finally ended up reporting everything that happened the previous year to the school. When I was done breaking down and explaining, I asked the woman I was talking to what would happen. Take a guess at what she said. ‚ÄúWell, maybe we‚Äôll just show them a presentation on why they shouldn‚Äôt bully people‚Äù And that never happened. 

If you‚Äôd have asked me the person I hated the most during that time, I would‚Äôve replied ‚Äúmyself‚Äù. I hated the fact I was always waiting for someone to come and ‚Äúsave me‚Äù while I was getting bullied, and I just sat there waiting like a little princess. I still wish I would‚Äôve stuck up for myself, but that‚Äôs easier said than done.

"19M, Married, Obese, Weak-Minded, Broke, Dreaming of Travel with Family ‚Äî Delhi or Hometown?","

I'm a 19-year-old married guy, and my life right now is in a very dark, confusing place. But I have dreams ‚Äî and I‚Äôm trying to get out of this hole, for myself and my family.

Here‚Äôs my raw truth:

I'm obese, have a girly voice, and likely suffer from low testosterone (no energy, low confidence, small penis, weak focus).

I'm physically strong, but mentally very weak.

I shake in small arguments, can‚Äôt talk loudly, and feel dizzy or lost all the time.

I have zero willpower and haven‚Äôt earned anything till now.

I‚Äôm fully dependent on my family, and we‚Äôre under a ‚Çπ4 lakh (~$5k) debt.

The only income is ‚Çπ30,000/month (~$350).

I‚Äôm currently doing BCA, but don‚Äôt feel confident in it.

I work at my father's shop in Delhi from 10 AM‚Äì3 PM and 6 PM‚Äì12:30 AM, and rest 3‚Äì6 PM. That‚Äôs my entire day.


Despite all this, I have two dreams:


---

1. To clear my family‚Äôs debt and earn ‚Çπ1 lakh/month (~$1200)
2. To take my family on a trip to places like Manali, Ladakh, and Mizoram ‚Äî someday soon


---

But now I‚Äôm stuck at a major decision point:

Should I stay in Delhi, where there are more learning/job opportunities (freelance, digital skills, agency jobs etc.) but I‚Äôm always exhausted from shop work and living under pressure?

Or should I move back to my hometown (Sheohar, Bihar), where I could open a small computer training centre, live cheaper, and possibly have more time ‚Äî but I won‚Äôt get the same exposure, speed, or digital clients that Delhi can offer?


---

My questions:

What would you choose in my position: Delhi hustle or hometown independence?

How do I fix my mind, body, and energy first?

What‚Äôs a real, practical skill I can learn in 2‚Äì3 hours/day and earn ‚Çπ1 lakh/month in 4‚Äì5 months?

Has anyone here climbed out of a place like this? What changed your life?



---

I don‚Äôt want pity or fake motivation. I want direction, structure, and real guidance.
If you‚Äôve been here, or helped someone through this, your comment could change a life.

"Anyone else kinda tired of the ""where you go to college doesn't matter"" pep talks","I agree mostly with the sentiment but: 

1) Sometimes these posts border on na√Øve - realistically it doesn't matter to a huge extent, but some posts are bordering on delusional acting like where you go to college won't make any difference in your life. Sure, you can succeed from any college, but don't act like certain colleges don't open up certain opportunities for you. This is field-dependent, but there are plenty of fields where it does very much matter where you go to college. 

2) As relevant as A2C is of a subreddit for these types of posts considering all the prestige-whores, the basis of this subreddit is to help students find help and camaraderie in the college admissions process to try and find the best college options for themselves - whether that's academically, fit-wise, or financially. If treating college admissions like it matters bothers you, honestly find another subreddit - a2c is not really good for anyone's mental health, so I don't know what people are really doing here if they are going to act like their above everyone because they came to the realization that college doesn't matter. Like this is a subreddit about college apps, ofc people are stressed out and care to some extent. I agree it's often unhealthy, but lowk the same pep-talk over and over again is not helping the issue. 

3) Stop with the anecdotal success stories of yourself, your cousin, or your uncle who went to community college and landed a 6 figure salary at facebook. I don't get the point of these anecdotes - I 100% agree with the sentiment that you can definitely succeed without a prestigious degree - but the success story is really an n=1 thing that won't make prestige-obsessed highschoolers change their minds. doesn't really support your argument well either. 

Anyways yeah i need to stop yapping and ranting. just to be clear im not a prestige-whore who thinks HSers should all be obsessing and stressing over which college they get into, all i'm saying is that these posts are often very ineffective, at least in my very PERSONAL opinion.

"Is it worth spending more if you get more freedom and peace?","For privacy reasons, I will not state the exact cost.

  
I am between two colleges, Francis Marion University and Coastal Carolina University. The thing is, I am a transfer student, so if I go to either one, I only have to spend 2 years and get out. I am planning to major in SCM and minor in data or marketing. 

  
I would say my experience at the CC was not the best, and I was very depressed due to how lonely I was. The college did not offer any clubs in regard to my interests. The reason I am posting this is due to a dilemma. I really would like to go to Coastal Carolina University, because it is a much bigger school with more opportunities around the city, and trying to gain some sort of independence from my strict household. But it also means that my father has to pay more than like 70k for like two years (all expenses). Whereas, if I were to stay home, I could finish my two years under 50k, since I would be living at home, meaning only covering my tuition. Also, before anyone says, ""Oh, get more scholarships,"" legally, I cannot qualify for it. 

I know at Coastal I can try to cover my expenses, but having more than 4 classes and managing a part-time job can be tough, and honestly, my dad still has to pay a bigger bill at the end of the day anyway. 

  
I talked to him today, and he said he is willing to help if I focus well on my education and try to progress somehow. I still am very undecided, even though he said yes, because it is a fuck ton of money for 2 years for a mid public school, and considering the economy, I might even have trouble looking for a job with a business degree. 

  
I really would like someone's insight on this. I don't have much time to decide. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m5p59n/is_it_worth_spending_more_if_you_get_more_freedom/","1753118769.0","ApplyingToCollege","Usual_Trifle1517"

"[URGERNT] I got a job offer but I go to college a month from today","(I HAVE TO REPLY IN 24HRS) Hi, I‚Äôm an incoming freshman. I‚Äôve been looking for a job since before the end of my senior year. My family and I were in the process of moving two weeks before I graduated. About a week before graduation, I received the address of our new house and started applying for jobs. I got a job interview around three weeks into summer break, but they ended up hiring someone two days before my interview, so I continued applying. Most of the places I applied to had job listings while they were no longer hiring or weren‚Äôt hiring at all. Then I applied to Target about three weeks ago‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know there was one pretty close to my house. I got a job offer today, but my start date is August 6th, and I start college on August 21st. I won‚Äôt be able to work on the 15th because it‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs birthday dinner. The day before she goes off to college, I want my last day to be the 20th, so I would only be working a few days if I accept, but I do need the money. My mom suggested I come home every weekend to work I live about 30 to 40 minutes from my college, depending on traffic, so I‚Äôm not sure if that will work I‚Äôve been burnt out before, and it took me a year to recover I used to get sick from stress when I had a job in 11th grade, and I got demotivated and depressed, even thinking about taking a gap year. I ended up recovering after a year and decided to go to college. No offense to my mom, but she‚Äôs the type to accept or suggest something and then complain about it, and I don‚Äôt want or need that. My mom doesn't like traveling more than 30 minutes if it's not for vacation or for college.  So please, I need advice. 

So what I‚Äôm asking is, should I decline the offer, should I take the offer and only work for 2 weeks, or should I work on the weekend and maybe end up burnt out and depressed?

Because of college credits from HS (and other factors like the stars literally aligning), it‚Äôs possible for me to cram my bachelors, masters, and minor all in 4 years (yes I‚Äôve confirmed with my advisor). The problem is that while it‚Äôs possible, I‚Äôll have to take a good amount of classes per semester and will likely be stressed and overworked.

On the flip side, I could spread it out in 5 years but I would have alot of extra time/unecessary elective slots to fill in order to keep certain scholarships.

"Just turned 17, feeling unsuccessful and worrying about the future","please respect my post, I'd gladly appreciate it 


I hope im in the right subreddit. Lately I've been feeling short or like I haven't achieved goals in life like everyone else has. I also feel like I haven't been making new connections for a while and is feeling stagnant. Also haven't been getting them high remarks, and the highest general average I could get was 89 while everything else was ranging from 81-90+. I'm not sure if starting a side career just for popularity (by starting a youtube channel) would help me a bit reach some people I'd like to give or have informations in between, kind of like I wanna build a community as I feeling left out, or probably not but still continue creating a channel alone without all of that stuff, just by letting it grow by itself. 

Honestly, since quarantine dropped back in 2020, it has affected me ever since, like I've been failing to keep connections, keeping focus with someone I am having a chitchat with, and eye contact most importantly. 

The things I am passionate right now is everything about tech and electronics. My main focus lately is trying to be an I.T, but if that didn't worked maybe I should just keep being an electrical engineer which kind of sucks I guess. Or maybe I should be focusing on becoming an electrical engineer first then my failsafe would be becoming an I.T guy? I'm not sure

Second stuffs is being an audiophile as I really like how the early 80s-2000s sounds like for how producers and artists back then cares that much about quality and fidelity. Not because of genres or stuffs like that, but because of how they're so different and original than nowadays, I mean, not that I hate modern stuff, they're great if they're being put into a proper use. Also would like to put a hard mention on quality over quantity like everyone nowadays doesn't do, and is doing the complete opposite. lol

If I move out to another state, the area I would have to reside in is honestly depressing. I would have no friends or family. The setting is very gloomy and empty compared to my hometown. There are seriously no college students. I would be minority (seriously). No people out on the streets enjoying the weather. It's just a quiet town for middle aged people. I just know I would get depressed. 

If I stay in the state I have grown up in my whole life (w/ fam), I feel happy because I have friends here.

Like I won't look forward to work at all. I just feel so stuck and sad because both choices would have its cons. Any advice?

The tricky thing is that I already signed the job offer with the L&D hospital. But now that I am looking for apartments and getting a feel of the town, I feel like I don't fit in.

I took a gap year out of high school, started bartending at 18, was making great money.

Fast forward a few years I got my A.A. Dec. 23‚Äô, (yes I know it took me a minute but I was a part time student and part time worker) I flip flopped between my career path and eventually landed on radiology. I applied to one program and by the grace of god I got accepted. 
I‚Äôm so thankful and grateful to be presented this opportunity, because the last three years I‚Äôve been wanting to get out of the restaurant industry and into an actual career with steady pay, benefits, consistent hours etc. 
With all that being said, I have help from my parents where they can provide, but I don‚Äôt have the privilege to straight up quit my job while in the program. And they can‚Äôt straight up pay for my program and everything on top of it for me. On top of all that this program is $1,500 per semester (there‚Äôs five semesters). Not including paying for my own books, scrubs, etc. 
This program is physically demanding with 5 day, 40 hour weeks of clinicals and classes. I know in my mind I can really do this thing and stick it out for that ending I‚Äôve always wanted. 
I just really am looking for a peace of mind that this will all pay off in the long run. I understand the program itself isn‚Äôt asking for an arm and a leg per se but I‚Äôm anxious and stressed about being in debt for the first time in my life. 
By no means am I saying that the restaurant industry isn‚Äôt an actual career field, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve never wanted to stay in for the long run. I‚Äôve loved working in this industry for as long as I have, I‚Äôve built great hospitality skills and met many amazing people, so please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm shitting on the restaurant industry in any way because I would not be where I am today without it.

"Dating app frustrations","I (43 m) deleted all of the dating apps that I was on and below are my thoughts.

Facebook Dating - I met the most long lasting people on here - I actually became friends with a couple of the women on this app.  The advantages of fb dating is that you can see their profiles sometimes if they are mutual friends and see what they look like or how they kind of are in real life. The plus side also is that FB Dating is free.

Bumble - I met 6 women here - 2 of which I still talk to.

Hinge - I matched with several women but never met anyone.

Tinder - I matched with a couple of women but never met them.

Stir - I used the app briefly - there aren‚Äôt many users in my area so I didn‚Äôt match with anyone.

I‚Äôve used them off and on for 2 years - made some connections - but no relationships or dates really.

All dating apps are designed to keep you on the platform as long as possible and are all designed (except fb dating) to get you to spend money (at least on the men‚Äôs side).

The only one that really wins on dating apps is the apps from what I‚Äôve see.

I‚Äôd say about 30% of the ‚Äúwomen‚Äù I‚Äôve seen were fake profiles. It‚Äôs pretty obvious with Facebook dating because you can tell the ai pictures and then once in a while you see a picture of a guy on the last profile picture. It‚Äôs kind of funny, like the scammer puts in his own picture as one of the pictures lol.

So you have actual fake profiles and then you have ai or weird angles or a lot of edited pictures for the real people.

I met several women who looked nothing like their profile pictures. Like at all, which I don‚Äôt see the point in not showing real, or current, pictures because when we meet it will be obvious if someone is lying.

It‚Äôd be like if a guy said he was 6‚Äô2 and shows up and he‚Äôs 5‚Äô9. It‚Äôd be obvious if he is lying.

I‚Äôve heard from several female friends that they get thousands of swipes and are overwhelmed. Similarly    a lot of men have to swipe hundreds or thousands of times before they have a meeting or date with a match.

I think dating apps create this fallacy that there might be someone better on the next swipe. So sometimes we pass up on a potential match because we think there‚Äôs something better on the other side.

But then everyone ends up alone and lonely.

I have a couple of ideas that I‚Äôm going to be launching.

One of them is a dating tshirt. I‚Äôve done this for myself and have tested it out and it works.

The other is an online forum that sorts by geographic area.

If you have any interest in either of these let me know.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m61t86/dating_app_frustrations/","1753149752.0","Adulting","Darknessbeforedawn24"
"Help","I don‚Äôt even know where to start because this isn‚Äôt just about my siblings‚Äîit‚Äôs about my whole life at this point. But I need advice before I actually lose my mind.

I‚Äôm 23 and still living at home, but it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lazy or don‚Äôt want to leave‚Äîit‚Äôs because I physically can‚Äôt yet. I‚Äôm broke most of the time because I‚Äôm constantly spending my money to take care of my younger siblings. My mom barely helps at all. She‚Äôs either at work or at her boyfriend‚Äôs house (and trust me, she‚Äôs there more than she‚Äôs here). When she is home, she does nothing but scream at me about how the house needs to be spotless or how the kids need to be taken care of. She‚Äôll threaten to throw me out if the house isn‚Äôt clean enough or if she decides I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot doing enough.‚Äù Meanwhile, she literally does nothing to actually raise these kids or keep things running.

The kids are Zach (18), Dylan (16), Kenzie (13), and Justin (14). They eat like they‚Äôre in a competitive eating contest 24/7. I‚Äôll drop $300+ on groceries, and within a day or two it‚Äôs gone because they‚Äôll literally tear through it like it‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating‚Äîthey act like food is free and I can just magically replace it every time they binge through the kitchen. Half the time, I‚Äôm eating scraps because I have to make sure there‚Äôs enough for them.

On top of that, they won‚Äôt help with anything. No cleaning, no cooking, no chores. If I ask them to help, they ignore me or give me attitude. Dylan will only help if I threaten to take something away, and even then it lasts about five minutes. Zach doesn‚Äôt think he has to do anything because he‚Äôs ‚Äúan adult now‚Äù even though he literally lives here for free and doesn‚Äôt pay for sh*t. Kenzie and Justin couldn‚Äôt care less‚Äîthey‚Äôll sit in their rooms or do whatever they want and leave me to pick up the pieces.

The worst part is, I don‚Äôt want to just let the house fall apart because if I do, my mom will snap and tell me I‚Äôm out. But I can‚Äôt keep being the maid, chef, therapist, and provider either. I‚Äôm just stuck in this miserable middle place where no matter what I do, I lose.

This has basically been my life forever. My mom has never really been a mom to me. She‚Äôs manipulative, mean, and emotionally neglectful. If I try to stand up for myself, she‚Äôll either flip out or play the victim and act like I‚Äôm the problem. I‚Äôve been raising myself‚Äîand them‚Äîsince I was a kid. And now here I am, still doing it, except it‚Äôs ten times harder because everyone‚Äôs older, louder, hungrier, and more selfish.

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm asking anymore. How do I survive this without going crazy? How do I set boundaries when my mom literally threatens to throw me out? How do I get my siblings to respect me at all when they see me as just another person to take advantage of?

Any advice would help, or even just someone to tell me I‚Äôm not insane for feeling like this. Because right now, I feel like I‚Äôm drowning

"How to make College Life more Fulfilling?","Hello! I'm going into my 3rd year of college. I was planning on going into Computer Science, but tbh I haven't been feeling it lately. In fact, I haven't felt ""it"" at all for the large majority of college. My time here has felt unfulfilling. My classes feel like busywork, and I don't feel like I've really learned anything. I've just been checking off boxes so i can get a degree that MIGHT help me find a job later. The rare time I start to feel a spark about anything related to school, it's almost immediately snuffed out by the fact that nobody cares outside of if I'm passing or not. The way people treat it sometime makes it feel like enjoyment comes second, and passing comes first. I've tried to find fulfillment in my hobbies, but like before, it's not something I can ""pass"" or put on a resume, so it comes second.

It's getting to the point where I can't focus on anything because I feel angry and anxious about ""wasting my life away,"" which becomes a self-fulfilling cycle because I fail my classes and have to take them again. I've never been good at studying in the first place, and it's even harder now that my self-confidence is in the gutter. I've done some thinking, and I think this relates back to my feelings around accomplishment. I wouldn't feel this way if it felt like I was doing something ""cool"" or ""important,"" but right now college feels like I'm stressing myself out for no reason. I'm looking for an avenue that gives me work that actually feel like something (i.e. not 9-billion tests on abstract integral problems), and someway I can find a community that also cares about the work we're doing. 

If anyone has any advice on what avenue I should take, I'd love to hear it!","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m629m2/how_to_make_college_life_more_fulfilling/","1753151050.0","college","FishShtickLives"
"I need adult advice please. I'm struggling bad mentally.","hello! i'm making this post in hopes of getting some kind of relief from my anxiety. 

i live in south carolina, i'm 24 years old, and i'm married. last year i did a medicaid application for 18 year old sister that had been living with me since she was 16 (i had legal custody of her) i did the application for only her, not myself as i had health insurance through the healthcare marketplace.

some time went on and one day i randomly got a letter in the mail saying i was signed up for first choice health insurance. i didn't think anything of it, i had done the healthcare marketplace application and already had a plan but i just assumed that since i personally didn't sign up for it that they just found me eligible or something through the marketplace. my sister was signed up for the same plan. i only used the health insurance through medicaid for one thing and one thing only - an eye exam and a pair of cheap medicaid glasses. it said that the insurance covered one exam a year for adults. the insurance was only active for a month before it cancelled on its own for both my sister and i, so i didn't bother cancelling it.

my eye exam was a year ago and now for some reason a couple days ago i get an email from the health insurance marketplace insurance that i had last year at the same time, of them saying that they got my claim for my eye exam from first choice, and they're reaching out to first choice for my information on their W-9. i have absolutely severe OCD and anxiety, and i am absolutely so worried that i somehow committed insurance fraud unintentionally?? the insurance card that i got from medicaid didn't even have my married last name on it, it was my maiden name, but that was the name they last had on file for me because the last time i had medicaid i wasn't married. i also wasn't employed at the time this all occured. can someone please make this make sense for me and reassure me that i'm not gonna go to jail?? i'm so stressed out to the point its all i can think about and i just wanna burst into tears. i'm young and dumb when it comes to this kinda stuff, so please don't be rude.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m63lnh/i_need_adult_advice_please_im_struggling_bad/","1753155002.0","Adulting","bxbyykenz"

"How to calculate how many hours of homework and studying within a course?","I‚Äôm a 2nd B.S Biology student who was overwhelmed with the workload from the 1st year of college. I completed a total of 27 hours my first year. For my first semester of college, I took College Algebra(3 hours), college algebra recitation(0 hours), Texas Government(3 hours), Music Appreciation (3 hours), First Year Seminar(3 hours), and General Psychology(3 hours). These courses kicked my ass since I was still transitioning from high school to college. I learned quickly that learning and applying what you know is crucial than just showing up to lectures and treating college like high school. This spring I took Pre-Calculus(3 hours), Pre-Calculus recitation (0 hours), English II(3 hours), and Intro to Philosophy(3 hours). The workload was manageable but I was still struggling to manage my time. I would try to finish all of my homework for a particular day of class so I could study the same day I finished my homework. I don‚Äôt like breaking down assignments into multiple days, but since that method of grinding homework assignments in one day was not helping, I need to figure out an alternative to managing these assignments along with labs and recitation courses. I‚Äôm now returning into the fall with 7 classes for a total of 12 credit hours. I need 12 credit hours if I want to be considered a full time student. Financial aid is also requiring me to be a full time student at 12 credit hours. I am taking Calculus 1( 3 hours), Calculus 1 Lab(1 hour), General Chemistry 1(3 hours), General Chemistry 1 Lab(1 hour), General Chemistry Recitation(0 hours) General Biology(3 hours), General Biology Lab(1 hour). I am also in a Catholic club that is hosting Bible studies once a week on Fridays for 2 hours. I don‚Äôt know if this is humanly possible but I will give it my best shot to pass all these courses with an A. I also train MMA twice week. Those 2 days out of the week is where I train Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai back to back. Hence, 2 classes one day, and another 2 the next. Each class is an hour long.

"Any advice for a young couple trying to rent an apartment?","Me (M20) and my boyfriend (M20) are planning on getting a place together when we both graduate college in 2 years. I currently live with my parents and he lives alone in an apartment complex at his university (which he doesn't have to pay for since it is part of his on-campus job). I stay over at his place for days at a time at least every weekend so we already have a taste of what living together will be like. It is awesome and we work so well together!!! We rarely ever argue and when we do, it is always short lived and we never stay mad for more than a few hours. I'm not too worried about our relationship lasting when we move in together or anything, I'm more just concerned about how we're going to afford a decent place considering that we live in Los Angeles county and housing costs an arm and two legs. I also would love to bring my two cats with us but I'm not sure how that will work out. As of right now, I make around $1200 a month (it varies) as a restaurant server and my boyfriend will not have a paying job after his summer employment is over but he did just submit a bunch of applications for paid internships. 

If anyone could give us ANY advice I would really appreciate it. Specifically with saving money, renting, keeping good credit, or just anything you wish you had known before you rented your own place for the first time.

The downside, I left with only 45 credits to go.
Back then, I wasn‚Äôt going to school for me,  I was doing it to please my parents, and I was studying something I absolutely HATED. I‚Äôve grown a lot from that point and realized I want to pursue something that actually makes me happy. My mindset now is: life is too short to live with regrets that I can control. If something makes me happy, why deny myself? I‚Äôm seriously thinking about transferring to a different school and enrolling in their online B.S. in Spanish program. It feels more aligned with what I care about. I‚Äôve got a couple of concerns:

1. My low GPA. I left with a 1.89 due to everything I was dealing with mentally. It‚Äôs not a reflection of my actual ability, but I worry it‚Äôll hurt my chances of being accepted.
2. The gap. I‚Äôve been out of school since 2021, and I‚Äôm concerned my old credits might not transfer or still count.

Every event I‚Äôm dedicated to I walk home, wait somewhere for hours to avoid transportation difficulties, beg my family, or pay uber.

I‚Äôm pretty broke because I pay for all my lunch fees and test fees and study materials. Whenever there‚Äôs a school expense, I always have to pay my mom back if she uses her account.
But even my studies been going downhill this year. I used to have a weighted 4.1 -> 4.0 (3.7->3.5 unweighted) because I got a D in hon physics and a C in hon alg2, thought it might change after I finish my summer classes.
My sat score was 1350 and act 30, but it‚Äôs below average.
I‚Äôm definitely sure I have a mental problem, but it‚Äôs not like I can get that diagnosed so there‚Äôs no possibility to justify my stagnation. I‚Äôve been told that writing about trauma is cliche, but nothing else stands out about me.
My parents make a lot of money so I don‚Äôt qualify for financial aid. They don‚Äôt care about what I do so I need to guide them through everything to get them to understand anything related to my school life or grades. They work all the time so I feel bad bothering them.

The last time I was in a relationship was last year, and since then, every date I've been on has been a huge waste of time to the point where I've just stopped asking people out on dates. No idea how to describe it other than it feels transactional, and a lot of Gen Z women I've met refuse to commit and ask for situationships or hookups instead. I still refuse to do that even if it means I have to stay alone.

Don't take this post the wrong way. I've been single for a while, and I'm quite happy staying single, but after dipping my toes into the dating pool for a bit, it makes me worried for the future when I actually do try to find someone to settle down with. It's a bit exhausting to say the least, but I don't know what's causing it.

For me it's not even getting dates that's the problem, it's just finding someone decent from dating that I would commit to AND wants to commit to me, which is surprisingly hard to find.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1m6aqzv/is_dating_still_worth_it_in_this_generation_how/","1753181028.0","GenZ","CharacterAccess770"
"Help w college?","Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, pls lmk and Ill remove it! 

I am autistic, and tend to need more step-by-step instruction on how exactly to do things. How on earth to get into college is definitely one of those things lmao, but none of my friends/family will help, or they just havent gone and dont know how. I spent about 0 of my time worrying about colleges in HS, and know borderline nothing about it. If anyone could help Id really appreciate it! 

I know I want a community college, I have a few nearby ones inmind & prolly a hybrid program. No ideal career inmind, I was thinking just a basic degree (If thats a thing?) (Also wtf are credit hours? do i need to write that essay or smth,, idk man,,,)

"I (20f) and my bf (22m) live together and I want to live separately or even break up because he isn‚Äôt adult enough","Ill keep it short because Im rly exhausted. 

My boyfriend and I met a year ago. Im very independent and have been through a lot. He is the only man that has been treating me with pure intentions in my life & I love him.
The issue is that he is really traumatised. 
His mom and whole family are horrible criminals and drug addicts. He has been heavily neglected until I met him. 
Unfortunately I did not understand the extent of his trauma until we moved in together, it has been 3 months since. 
He has huge issues being an adult in general. 
No sense of responsibility, he forgets due dates, important chores, loses his jobs & doesn‚Äôt do the household properly.
We are both autistic & traumatised and I had A LOT of understanding until now. 
He also is a pathological liar of some sort & lies every time he is scared to tell the truth. If its to make himself look better or hide flaws of his. 
Though he NEVER has been the violent kind, he doesn‚Äôt watch adult movies & he is extremely respectful towards women. 
He also has many qualities I appreciate. 

Two months into living together he lost his job and Ive been working 2 damn jobs (24/7) to keep us fed & a roof over our heads. 
He doesn‚Äôt make a big enough effort to find a job or take work off of my shoulders. 
Honestly he is just making it worse times ten‚Ä¶ 
I constantly remind him and its literally like Im his mom. He acts like a damn teenager too. 

He blames his issues on the fact that he needs time to learn how to be an adult & that he is really depressed. But today he lied to me again about making a VERY IMPORTANT appointment & I lost it. 

To make things clear Im disabled, have 2 jobs and shouldn‚Äôt even be working more than 60%. 
He owes me so much money atp and I cannot pay the rent to this apartment on my own. 
I feel my body shutting down and Im TERRIFIED of being homeless again. 
(Im 20 and its been about 2 years of me having a roof over my head) 

Today I told him Ill kick him out tonight & he can sort out himself where he sleeps. He has no family or friends. It breaks my hard but he always pulls the victim card and I cant do it anymore. 
Not even 3 months into playing house I have to leave my first actually nice ‚Äúhome‚Äù
Im devastated. 
Do you think I should pull through? Moving will financially ruin me again lol. 

Is it a bad idea to keep dating a nonfunctional adult while moving out? Like separating but staying together? 
I really like him & what is below that trauma and we have a lot of similarities.

"ppl r hating on me bc they think I'm a nepo","I got a paid position at a lab (biotech, bme)(also a small company, hence the hire), and people think that I got it through connections. But in reality, I spent every single night writing cold emails to over 40 professors and companies just hoping for some sort of reply. Only one person offered. So i took it. It doesn't make it any better that I am an upcoming sophomore in high school because apparently I am wayyy too young to get this position through pure hard work. I have the skills that they needed, so they hired me. What is so wrong with that? My cousin gave me the idea of cold emailing profs, but that's all. I did the work my self. And when I tell ppl that, they are blinded by the word 'cousin' and think they did all the work, even when I clearly said I typed up all the emails myself. I was talking to my friend, and they said ppl were talking about me and how I got this job through 'connections' and calling me a nepo kid. 

Research has become a popular ec for many people just to get into a t20 or ivy. But for the high schoolers who acc enjoy it we get hate from others because of assumptions, especially at my school. Obviously the kids who get a position from their parents or go to a extremely expensive research camp that does the work for u are the real nepo teens. I just don't understand why I am getting so much hate for something I genuinely enjoy doing. 

On a side note this was just supposed to be a summer job but ive been given projects that could last up to a year (publications) and I really want to take it on and complete it. Im not sure if I should continue to work during school bc im taking a lot of honors and 2 aps + other ecs/sports or just end this in the summer.

"I Had To Drop A Class","The nice woman that helped me choose my classes recommended that I take a summer class. Worst decision of my life. 

I suffered with class, screamed and cried over it. It wasn‚Äôt very mature and I do suffer from mental problems that impair my ability to think straight. 

I decided with the choices I had, I would drop it. I went to my community college and talked with the counselor and got things done. She decided that dropping the class would be better. It was much better than taking the F. 

For context, this was a summer math class. I had less time to do it and not the right help.

I was so far behind and I wasn‚Äôt understanding the class.

I‚Äôm happy that I dropped this class! It was causing so much stress. I know I have to take it again some time but at least now I can enjoy the rest of my summer.

I also learned a valuable lesson. DO YOUR WORK. I was so far behind because I was slacking off. I‚Äôll never do that again

"Feeling Really Stressed About Lack of ECs as a Rising Senior","Looking at this sub and people around, I'm kind of realizing how little time I have left in high school and how I kinda fucked up. Like, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack because I feel like I‚Äôve built up a decent profile in other areas, but my extracurriculars are where I really fall short. And the problem is that ECs are kind of everything, and that's the one space I did horribly at. Like during freshman and sophomore years, I honestly didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to be doing. I‚Äôm not trying to make excuses, but all I had were a few participation-type clubs, nothing meaningful. When I finally tried to focus during junior year, I felt like it was too little, too late. Now, especially since I‚Äôm aiming for something like pre-med, I feel like my ECs are just too weak, and that I‚Äôve already ruined my chances. It‚Äôs honestly overwhelming. I‚Äôm just wondering: are weak extracurriculars really the end of the road when it comes to getting into a good top 25 school? Like the more I look around me the more I feel stressed.

"Do I Quit Or Stay For a LOR?","Hi! So, I'm doing this IRL lab internship nearby, and it has a LOT of students (almost everyone from my school goes here), and it's cool because you learn real lab skills and do your own project and it's really hands-on. I've been here this whole year and I led my own project, was really involved, and went to research conferences.

  
But, the advisors are really mean (mine is nicer but still üò≠) and it's a REALLY big time commitment. Especially since I'm going into Junior Year.

I don't think I'm going to get a paper out of it, which I originally thought I would. But, after a while I realized I would just do it for the skills and experience.

Now, I've when to conferences, and learned a BUNCH of different lab skills (which are really cool!!) but I don't think it's worth the time commitment and mental stress anymore.

The only reason I would stay is for a Letter of Rec from my advisor, but he does them based on participation. While he likes me right now, I know I won't be in lab as much throughout the school year, so I'm not sure if I would even get a good letter in the end?

And the seniors under my advisor didn't end up at the best schools either, so I'm not sure if this is even as important to apps as I thought. (The other advisor sends many kids to T20s, but they also publish a LOT more.)

However, if I leave then the other activities I'm doing are kinda just ""ideas"" for passion projects right now, so I'm worried I'd be ditching something valuable and end up regretting it.

Sorry it's so long but TL;DR:

Should I stay in this lab, with a low chance of publishing (but not zero?) and the potential to get a LOR (but it would be a BIG time commitment). OR, do I quit and focus on other things?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m6373p/do_i_quit_or_stay_for_a_lor/","1753153786.0","ApplyingToCollege","ClassicPassionSlice"
"How to move on from not being able to attend dream school for whatever reason and settling for CC","Hey guys. I'm currently committed to community college but feel like caca. I got into UCLA, UC Berkeley, and a couple other good schools but spent every waking moment of high school thinking about college etc. I got into Northwestern too and committed but pussied out because it seemed like it was going to be a little pricy but not meaningfully (like over 4 years maybe 30 grand more) + I have a complicated family situation (single parent with limited family support around who is unstable health wise and has stage 3 cancer) and I got super scared of being far from home in general for no reason. I decommitted in June after my mom got bad test results and I was just under an insane amount of pressure and felt so overwhelmed. I asked multiple times if they could reinstate me after the fact and they were well aware of my situation but they refused as well.

I just got the craziest amount of cold feet basically even though it was my dream for years, Idk what came over me. I've only been out of state once.
Not only did I limit myself in terms of my career prospects (l'd like to go into business), but I always wanted to gtfo of LA and Northwestern was my dream school since I was a jit. It's genuinely made me depressed . I've gained 20 pounds this summer and am not excited about college at all just stressed and depressed and like I've seriously limited myself.

i‚Äôm good at the job, haven‚Äôt really had any huge drawbacks. i‚Äôve gone through training smoothly and have gotten good scores at the end of each day the whole time. all of my coworkers/trainers/supervisors say i‚Äôm smart and i‚Äôm great at it. i‚Äôm not trying to brag or anything of course, i‚Äôve made mistakes just like everyone but i‚Äôm trying to say that i‚Äôm not reconsidering because i‚Äôm struggling with training or anything.

all of my other jobs were very hands-on, i worked with animals for years but decided to leave because i got incredibly burnt out with it and wanted something different. so i applied for this job and got it! i was so happy to have something different and i like all of my coworkers, plus the 10-hour shifts are nice.

however‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm going absolutely stir-crazy in the dispatch center. my city is usually not incredibly busy, so there will be pretty long periods of time that i‚Äôm just kinda sitting there occupying myself until i get a call or an officer/firefighter says something. my coworkers all kinda seem content about sitting quietly at their desks, which is fine but i‚Äôm struggling with it. i tried to combat this by walking around the room, but my trainer said i took to long to get back to the desk when an officer said something, so now i‚Äôm just sitting.

i can‚Äôt stand being stuck in the same room all day with no fresh air or anything. i‚Äôm also afraid i‚Äôm gonna gain weight/have health issues from being sedentary for long periods of time. i try to occupy myself with reading, writing etc but i‚Äôm just so incredibly bored. i can‚Äôt imagine doing this routine for many years. is this a normal feeling? i‚Äôm terrified of night shift because it‚Äôs going to be dark, quiet, i‚Äôll be tired, there will only be one other person there.

hi everyone. i‚Äôm posting this along with my amazon wishlist in hopes of getting help with some things i genuinely need but can‚Äôt afford on my own. i know times are tough for a lot of people right now, so thank you just for reading. i‚Äôm on disability for: crohn‚Äôs disease, depression, anxiety, CPTSD, PG, and autism. i make just enough to keep my lights on and my rent paid with my check, anything extra goes to my cats first. i feel like i should make it clear that i didn‚Äôt decide ‚Äúoh let me just go get 2 cats, it‚Äôs fine i‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù they were in danger and i couldn‚Äôt let them stay in that situation. rest assured i make sure they have plenty of food, water, and litter. they even have some dollar tree toys that a friend dropped off to me. i don‚Äôt have a car, and i‚Äôm struggling with some type of agoraphobia because leaving the house has become almost impossible. 

before anyone asks‚Äîyes, i‚Äôve tried every local resource available to me.
i‚Äôve reached out to local churches, furniture banks, food pantries, and community organizations in my area. unfortunately, most programs don‚Äôt have funding or support unless you have minor children living with you. single adults‚Äîeven disabled ones like me‚Äîtend to fall through the cracks.

i do get food pantry deliveries sometimes, which i‚Äôm grateful for, but a lot of the food i receive contains things i medically can‚Äôt eat. i end up giving away about half of what i‚Äôm sent. i also now have an abundance of items i don‚Äôt need, like puppy pads and toothbrushes, because they come in every pantry box even though i don‚Äôt have a dog or kids.

about domestic violence help:
i‚Äôve also tried to get support from a local DV shelter, but i wasn‚Äôt eligible because:
	1.	i left my abuser while he was at work instead of involving the police‚Äîwhich is safer for many of us. but if there‚Äôs no current or active police report, they won‚Äôt offer shelter or services.
	2.	even if i had called the police, the local DV shelter was so full they were going to send me 45 minutes away to a different one i‚Äôd already been to. i can‚Äôt go back there because i was caught sneaking out at night to return to him. (i‚Äôve since left for good.)

if you‚Äôve made it this far‚Äîthank you. truly.
i‚Äôm just trying to survive and make my space more livable and safe. if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. i‚Äôm happy to answer. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Worried about workload! Advice needed/wanted!","I currently plan on taking 16 credits (five, sixteen week long classes) next semester: BIO-110 (4 credits, required, lab-based), SPA-111 (3 credits, required, Elementary Spanish), ENG-112 (3 credits, writing/research), PSY-237 (3 credits, social psychology), and PHI-215 (3 credits, philosophy). I am starting to worry this might be too much, especially with BIO-110‚Äôs labs, and could use your advice! I want to make sure I graduate on time and stay in my graduating class year, so I know that having a larger, more intense workload for one semester is worth it; I just don't want to get overwhelmed.

**Background**: I got an A in high school biology, and I‚Äôve been told BIO-110 is similar to high school level, so I feel okay, but nervous about the labs. I‚Äôm strong in writing (love ENG-112‚Äôs focus) and critical thinking (excited for PHI-215 and PSY-237). I have some psychology background, which helps with PSY-237, and A1 Spanish skills (from Duolingo) for SPA-111, which is great for my career goals. School is my only focus - no job, just casual hobbies (crocheting, learning Korean for fun). I‚Äôm motivated to push through for law school, but don‚Äôt want to burn out.

**Questions**:

* Has anyone taken a 16-credit load with a lab science like BIO-110? How did you manage the labs alongside humanities/social science classes?
* Any tips for staying organized with five classes and balancing study time (especially for biology labs, writing essays, and psych readings)?
* Any strategies to avoid stress with a heavy semester?

"Is it wise to ask my parents NOT to pay for my college?","I'm currently in community college and it's been.. mediocre. I was a 3.5+ GPA person for most of HS, but my second semester of college hit me like a truck. I fell apart without a pre-built system and failed ALL of my classes. Ever since then, I've been trying to rebuild my GPA, but I still have a few classes I put off and then eventually drop or fail. I lost a scholarship, regained it, then lost it again. I've had to do trial and error with online, class loads, studying, etc. just to figure out how to be decent again. I still get C's.

I had always suspected something was up with me, but didn't get diagnosed and medicated until recently. I do think that meds will help me for next semester, but.. I'm not confident that I'll do great like I need to. I can notice patterns. I love learning (whatever I'm fixated on at the time, anyways) and I have a clear cut path in mind. I even have backup degrees, and if THOSE don't work out, I have plans for a non-college career. I want to make money and provide for myself and my partner. I want to be an academic again... but for some reason, I seem to lack this, ""inner drive."" Even if I NEED to finish something, even if I NEED to focus, I just fumble it. (And before anyone asks, I have depression and have been on meds for a while. I have hope for life and want that ideal future to be real, so I don't feel like it's the depression, but who knows.)

My parents have offered to pay for my debt in the future on the condition that I stay in college, and so far they've paid for the portion of my classes not covered by my scholarship, but... the more I think about it, the more I feel like I can't accept it. Truthfully, I'm spoiled and selfish. I'm used to my parents bailing me out of difficult situations, like paying for my failed semester even when they were obviously upset at me. I'm used to them being soft on me due to my mental illness. Of course I feel guilty, but beyond that, I've developed a hypothesis that I really need to take on that debt for myself. I need to have immediate consequences for failure to do my work. 

Of course, the concept makes me nervous, especially in the current economy. I tried to take a gap semester following my failed semester to figure myself out and my parents refused. They pointed to my aunt, who's still paying off tens of thousands of loans decades after dropping out. That scared me, but I feel like I needed to be. I don't want to even live with the mindset of ""my parents will bail me out later"" because I know myself and I know that I will inevitably take advantage of it.

Has anyone else experienced a dilemma like this or decided to take on their own loans? How did you go about it, how did you tell your parents? Would I be making the wrong choice?

"gym makes me feel miserable","a bit of a vent to get off my chest. i feel like my mental health goes in the trash every time i leave the gym. going to the gym makes me forget about other things going on in my life that I'm stressing out on but instead it gets replaced with other negative thoughts. 

I started the gym last year for improving my fitness, health and appearance. I don't feel i have made much significant progress. my progress in strength and weights is not growing well. I've tried everything - from trying to increase in weights, to progressive overload to starting more reps in lower weights etc. I hate that I'm so weak and I hate that my brain can't even grasp simple instructions or imitate what others are doing. my body goes against every form I don't get it. I hate being dyspraxic and having co-ordination motor issues.

i feel completely blocked and plateaued and nothing is helping me. even after I've made countless posts on beginner threads but nothing is ever sticking. I've practiced so much but I can never get the forms correctly, videos do not help and I can't afford a PT. I cant keep track of my diet and every time I eat I feel horrible that I'm wasting any exercise I've done. i hate seeing myself in the mirror and random reflections. I cant sleep very well. I'm just a big fat failure and I can't do anything right. I always suck at my sets - I do well on the first but always always get worse in the following ones - regardless if I go too heavy or light. I hate being so weak.

I still blindly go three times a week hoping something will change but I feel like I'm being held back and I can't get past any barriers. I feel absolutely defeated every time I leave the gym and I feel trash about my own body and appearance.

I don't know when or if I'll not feel so horrible after the gym. it just always comes and I feel I can't celebrate much small wins when it takes just a glance at the mirror or someone making a comment. I just feel garbage, lost and directionless. there is probably deeper issues in my life other than the gym making me feel this way too tbh

My mental health was horrible, I had a lot going on at home and my chem teacher was on maternity leave so it put the class in an iffy spot. I tried getting extra help during study hall to no avail. 

At my school you need at least three years of a science to fulfill your graduation requirements. The following semester I took cp physics and got an 86. I want to go into medicine (probably something related to behavioral science). I‚Äôm questioning if I should even go into this because I haven‚Äôt taken any STEM based ap‚Äôs (mostly humanities with the exception of AP CSP) and my test scores aren‚Äôt that great. 

Up until 8th grade I also had an IEP for math‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to set myself up for failure in college but I‚Äôm not the strongest in other subjects either. Across the board I‚Äôm mostly just a B student whether it‚Äôs in a cp, honors, or AP. I know that this will raise red flags to admission officers and I have no idea what to do.

"Does anyone else feel discouraged whenever they see another post/announcement of a friend/coworker/former classmate their age getting married?","I'm 24. I know that 24 still very young. And honestly, even though I would like to have a romantic partner partner and get married one day, I don't feel like I'll be ready for marriage until at least another 6 years from now. I don't feel like I'll be ready to have kids until another 10 years from now. 

Occasionally, on my social media, I'll see people announce their proposal or them getting married.And if I'm still in contact with them, I'm happy for them. If not, I just wish him well and go on about my day. But I will admit that there's a part of me that gets worried. Because even though I know that I still have time, it takes a long time to establish a relationship. And for that person to get married to you. And have kids with that person.

And you know, I guess its fine because I was a minor but I literally couldn't even go see my friends without her flipping out every which way I went. Like I literally stopped off at a gas station one time and she started freaking out thinking I was trafficked. So I stopped hanging out with friends. And she would track it when I wasn't driving home soon enough for my curfew at 10...and talked about my speed all of the time. I turned it off at 18. Recently I let her back on because I thought it would be good for safety reasons. And she's been abusing her privledges again...even if I uber. All of the time, ""you were up late last night,"" ""where were you,"" ""I saw you went there,"" etc. Really pisses me off.

"I'm good at math, but i hate math class, how can I make homework more bearable","I'm coming up on my Junior year and have to take ap precalc, which comes packaged with a required summer assignment of previous year's (algebra 2) review. I cant opt out of this because I either cant go backwards or its just socially unacceptable to regress in math courses or something  
What makes it worse is that I already know that i want to become an animator (specifically hand drawn), which, very obviously, barely uses math, so all math is to me is stuff that's barely related to real life, besides the off mention of something like compound interest that gets 10 minutes of focus. All it feels like math is is just doing what random instructions the teacher tells you to do to some random abstract numbers and you get the answer (whoopdie doo)  
This line of thinking is probably flawed but school doesn't give me a reason not to think this way.  
And when i get hours of homework to do, it feels like a waste of time that could be used to actually improve at the skills I need for the job I want.   
And sometimes when I'm an hour+ into math homework it even reminds me about everyone's impending mortality *but* *that's fine...*   
It also activates the procrastinator in me and I end up avoiding my math homework and personal art projects by playing games

My university is a really good school but it‚Äôs about 90k a year so I would love to save a full year of tuition. I was just wondering, in this situation, how do grad activities and everything work? I‚Äôm worried that during my ‚Äúsenior year‚Äù I‚Äôll be all alone in senior activities bc the class I‚Äôm starting with will be graduating a year later. So how does stuff like that work in college? Is it normal to be friends with people outside of ur grade? I don‚Äôt wanna sit alone at graduation or anything lolll.

"Struggling","Hey there everyone. Here is a rundown. I'm 21. I've already been enrolled into 2 colleges, and dropped out. I've never been good academically, no special scholarships (besides FAFSA Grants) to pay for tuition, no parent that can help financially support it, but I still took a vow (to myself) to get a degree sooner, rather than later.

2022, I moved on campus to a Trade School. At the time, I was dealing with the loss of my brother, and ended up dropping out a month into classes. (I actually just finished paying off my loans last year, from the 1 month I was there)

This past year, I enrolled in Online Classes (due to the fact that I have a full time job that I cannot give up to attend classes in person) and those classes have also, since, been dropped. And with how they were sat up to be ""self paced"", it made it extremely difficult for me. And if I were to go back to college, it would be in person....

I'm looking for literally anything y'all have. Tips, experiences and solutions, outcomes, anything. 

Thank y'all.

"31 y/o brother has never left home","My younger brother has been concerning me. He‚Äôs 31, has never left home and has $10k to his name. It‚Äôs not a lot of money when he works full time and doesn‚Äôt pay any bills (my parents take $100 a month from him for his cell phone and $90 for his share of the utilities) he has minimal debt (I believe about ~2k in student loans as he went to CC and had Pell grants) and no cc debt. 

I‚Äôm not sure how he only has $10k saved up with no bills and making $34ish an hour. It seems he smokes a lot of weed, has recently started doing shrooms, so I assume a lot of his money goes to that and tattoos. He always talks about saving to move out and when I‚Äôve offered to help him figure out a life plan (rents are expensive in NY but I‚Äôve told him a decade ago to save so he can buy a home) he tells me he has it figured out and the 1 year plan becomes 2, then becomes 3 etc.

My parents are aging, trying to figure out their own next plan with retirement and selling their home but have started to wonder if they should include him in their plans since he shows no effort in being an adult and responsibilities. His time at home is spent playing video games and smoking. He has a good heart and I want the best for him but I am struggling with the prospect of him never growing up and learning how to adult and my parents passing. I‚Äôm not sure what would be next for him at that point. 

Any advice on how to encourage him to adult at this point? Tips on how to bring this concern up to my parents?

Anyways this is the background info i had no one to room with at the college I chose i was scared of having a random roommate so i knew a few friends also going to the same school (4 hours from my home town) so when they asked me to room with them i said yes. Im going to be a freshman and out apartment is 1 block off campus but its still student housing just not dorms.

Now im not sure how many people can relate but they are the type of friends to say that and not mean it just to mess around but now im nervous incase he and other roommates do try stuff i dont want it to interfere with my life plans (college, work) i work from home on the computer and often have video calls and chats.

One thing im scared of is that hell say offensive things or be blasting loud music on his dj set and board hes bringing down and this could get me in trouble with work. Another fear of mine is him stealing from me or going into my room and messing with my things. Another fear is him taking it to far and harassing me by touching me and throwing things at me (we always would joke around but I‚Äôm scared he might take something to far) another fear of mine is he has a fake id and i don‚Äôt want to be in trouble if he has drinks or vapes in our room

"How do people make friends as young adults??!","Hey reddit. I (19f) have a very very small group of people I talk to on a semi-regular basis (3-6, none of them know eachother) and I only hang out with any of them maybe once a month. I only work 35 hours a week. I try to go out, but I feel like there‚Äôs not much to do socially at this age that‚Äôs not as expensive as a concert ticket.
For some context, I moved around a LOT as a kid. I never developed any serious long-term friendships; I had two childhood best friends, but one lives over five hours away and we talk once a year, whereas the other girl and I stopped speaking when she began to abuse hard substances when we were 16. Covid happened my freshman year of highschool and I didn‚Äôt go back until my Junior year, where I got involved with a couple notorious girls that got me into some harder stuff while i was going through a lot at home. i lashed out on my peers and tried to come off as untouchable. as a result of that, I built myself a pretty poor reputation around my school as an unhinged user. since graduation in 2023. i went to university for a semester, but got roofied and assaulted by a boyfriend, which dug me deeper into substances. I became an addict and dropped out after a couple more incidents before going into recovery about a year and a half ago. 
I‚Äôve cut off all of the people from my past life and have been trying desperately to get a social life started again. I try to meet new people through social media, work, even some low-key parties or rave community gatherings but it feels like it‚Äôs impossible to connect with anyone. I‚Äôve always gotten along with people older than me, so I honestly find it hard to relate to or engage with people my age. But it feels like people over 21 don‚Äôt want to be friends with me because I can‚Äôt go out to most things they do, since most people I meet are ravers. I love to draw, I love to go camping, I love to explore my spirituality. I don‚Äôt just like raving. I try to connect with all kinds of people tbh. It just always feels like the other person is trying to avoid building a connection with me no matter what i do. 
How do people meet others at this age when you‚Äôre not in college? I feel so stuck. Where do you go that doesn‚Äôt cost like $25-200 for entry?

"Considering withdrawing since I cannot pay my college tuition, any advice I can do to prevent such?","Hello,   
  
As my title says, I am starting to consider withdrawing from my university as I am starting to grapple with the fact that I will most likely not be able to pay for my upcoming semester tuition. My previous year was my first year of college and it already took a bunch of money out of me, I don't know how I will be able to continue to afford to attend university as any funds I have are already low.   
  
My family can barely help me out here, we are not a well off family and are already stretched thin with having payments and bills. Only my stepfather works and my mother is unable to work or provide assistance due to a medical condition as well as needing to take care of our grandmother who recently underwent surgery and will be going right back under soon for a transplant.  
  
Even with financial aid and subsidized loans, the amount left to pay (around 3k USD) has me wondering where I could get the money from. The only option I have in front of me is a work-study option but I feel as if doing work and the amount of classes I will take this semester will negatively impact my grades. I barely get any scholarships too, and I refuse to take out any more loans that I already have, not to mention I don't want to have to burden my family even more with what they already have to worry about.  
  
If I withdrawl, I don't know when I'd even return to my university, I just hope that if I do so, I can land a job soon and save money for when I can return. My grades are in good standing so its not like I'd be leaving on bad academic terms. I'm just putting this out there just in case anyone could have some advice for me. I'm still young and just a year out of highschool.

I never flossed growing up ‚Äî my family just didn‚Äôt talk about it. I learned about it at 14 when I got braces. After they were removed, my teeth looked okay but always felt like they had an odd ‚Äúlayer‚Äù on them.

I didn‚Äôt get a cleaning after COVID due to lack of insurance. A few months ago, I finally went and had my teeth cleaned ‚Äî they felt light and smooth again. But the dentist said I had¬†**7 cavities**¬†and¬†**weak enamel**.

Now, a few months later, my teeth feel the same as before ‚Äî like they‚Äôre coated or not clean. I‚Äôm confused because I:

* Brush¬†**2‚Äì3 times daily**
* Floss every day
* Use¬†**Colgate high-fluoride toothpaste**¬†(prescribed by my dentist)
* Use¬†**Colgate mouthwash**
* Wear a¬†**retainer every night**
* **Use straws**¬†for tea/coffee
* **Rarely drink soda**¬†now (though I used to be addicted for a year)
* **Don‚Äôt smoke**¬†and¬†**rarely drink alcohol**
* Don‚Äôt have my¬†**wisdom teeth**, and likely never will

I'm 25 and feel completely stuck. I'm currently working as a forklift driver in the UK, earning decent money, and l've managed to save up a bit. On paper things seem alright-but mentally, I'm not where I want to be. I don't even know where that is.
Lately, l've been torn between two options: ‚Ä¢ Buy a house and ""settle"" a bit financially (even though I'm not sure I want to stay where I live now) ‚Ä¢ Use my savings to upskill - either get trained on more plant machinery (360s, cranes, etc.) or look into qualifications for a different kind of job entirely.
Deep down, I know I want more out of life. Not just more money, but better experiences, more freedom, purpose.
I've even thought about working abroad someday-but again, I have no idea where to start. I don't have a plan. I just feel like I'm floating.
Part of me feels like I'm wasting time in a job that won't take me where I want to be. But then again, I don't even know what ""where I want to be"" looks like. It's like I'm standing at a crossroads but all the signs are blank.
I've thought about therapy, but I don't think it would really help with this kind of directionless feeling. I don't feel depressed-just lost.

"I feel stuck at home with a passive father, no income, and no direction ‚Äî Is moving out or changing cities even possible for someone like me?","I'm 31 years old, and for the last 8+ years, I‚Äôve been living with my father after my mother passed away. Ever since her death, my father has shown no intention of discussing life, the future, or making any sort of plan ‚Äî not for himself, and definitely not for me.

He spends most of his time at the gurudwara and usually returns late. If I try to talk about what to do next or where our lives are headed, he just stays silent. And when I get frustrated and raise my voice, I‚Äôm the one blamed for being rude. Once in anger, I said things I regret ‚Äî and now he uses that as emotional leverage, saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell your relatives how you talk to me.‚Äù

But the truth is: for the first year after my mother died I waited for him to step up, to say anything. He never did. I asked him- what's plan now as there's no one to cook food and no income to buy food everyday.  

Out of survival, I tried freelancing ‚Äî blog writing, social media work, even got a few clients. But to keep going, I sacrificed my food and sleep to cut my food down to one meal a day. After 2‚Äì3 years of doing that, my health gave up ‚Äî I ended up with digestion issues and constant burnout. I then took a course hoping to upskill, but got into ‚Çπ20k debt, now 50k. I couldn‚Äôt repay it, so I asked my father for help. He gave me the money to pay the emi, but when I try to talk to him again and again same response. And, now there's another, saying ‚ÄúI gave you ‚Çπ20,000, no one even gets water in this world.‚Äù

He came home with langar since 7 years and he just place it on my bed when I am not home or around. It feels like I‚Äôm just existing in this house ‚Äî not living. Like I‚Äôm being tolerated, not supported. Just being allowed to stay and eat, and that‚Äôs supposed to be enough.

Now I feel drained. I don‚Äôt want to do freelancing anymore. I‚Äôve already tried. I don‚Äôt have any income. I have no savings. And mentally I feel stuck.:

I want to move out ‚Äî either rent a place, or shift to another city to find work. But I have no money, not any high income skill, yes I wrote so many words SEO blogs, grew IG pages but now it feels like a huge task to me and it doesn't generate income fast and stable and no one to back me.
I‚Äôm not lazy ‚Äî I‚Äôve done the grind. But is it even possible to break this loop without resources?
I am having sui**dial thoughts all the time, once even tried but stopped. (Took help of chatgpt to get words together as it's huge task to me to write and I was confused on what to do now)

Can someone like me ‚Äî with no savings, no backup ‚Äî move to another city and actually survive?

Are there ways to get a basic job that atleast not burden mentally or atleast pay goodthat covers rent and food, while I rebuild slowly?

Or should I stay in this situation and wait till I figure out a remote option again?

"So how exactly does one go about ""putting themselves out there?""","So I'm a 28 year old guy with basically no friends, and recently I've moved out on my own. That was my first big goal for myself.

Next I wanna meet people. Maybe meet someone to date, maybe not, but in general I just wanna have friends. Because as it stands I have two friends, both from High School, and neither of who are really available for things because they've been making these big strides in life. We kinda talk here and there, go out on occasion, but for the most part we're more friends because we don't want to lose that ""high school friend"" more so than because we actually do stuff together. I've also never been in a relationship.

I realize the reason for this is mostly myself. I just don't ""put myself out there."" I'm always worried I'm bothering people because any time I approach people, even in settings where it should be acceptable, I'm met with the side-eye stare and a very tepid, non-committal reply.

And I think a lot of that is because I don't really know *how* to ""put myself out there""

People always say go to bars, but I don't enjoy drinking and partying, and I mean, people are there with their friends. They don't want some random schmuck walking up and inserting himself into their chat.

People also always say to join a group based on your hobbies, but unfortunately my hobbies (Writing and gaming primarily) are all very insular. And there isn't really anything else that interests me. I don't want to just sign up for a class or something that I don't want to do because I don't want to make myself more miserable. Plus - and this is the real kicker - I don't exactly have a ton of money. I have enough to survive and slightly more, but I couldn't afford to take a class or anything like that.

I guess I'm just at a loss for what ""putting yourself out there"" really entails aside from lurking around bars and pestering people on the off chance you meet the other antisocial weirdo that nobody wants to talk to. 

So what do people actually *do* when they ""put themselves out there?"" Because the advice of ""just do it"" or ""go to a bar and cold approach people like a weirdo"" don't really work for me. Like, more concretely, what would one do?

I'm really looking to make a change, I just don't know what exactly I'm supposed to do. It's all so foreign to me.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m7h5ap/so_how_exactly_does_one_go_about_putting/","1753295436.0","Adulting","Cirkusleader"

"Class is making me suicidal.","What I am angry about:

- summer classes at my uni are either 6 or 9 weeks, entirely up to the professor. Professor chose to cram 10 weeks of material into 6 weeks.  I knew a 6 week class would be **hard**. However...

- it is an online, ""flipped"" classroom. He does not teach. We are given short lecture videos to watch. He has someone else grade everything. He is open to questions but his office hours clash with my other classes. 

- the lecture videos are almost completely useless. They are good introductory videos (usually around 5-10 minutes per topic) but they are useless when it comes to the exercises, assignments, exams. I have to supplement a LOT with my own learning. I say they are only almost completely useless because he throws in references to his own videos on exams, presumably to make sure we have watched them. 

- this is tangentially related but my mental health is bad. I am depressed and this class sucks any joy out of my life with how much time I need to spend on it. 

- instructions are vague and confusing, rubrics are very harsh and strict. The midterm class average was a 60%. 

Like I said I have no motivation for this class at all. I am suicidal from it. I pay thousands of dollars in tuition for this. I regret it deeply but I can't go back now.

"Need help with my slump","I'm going through an extremely bad slump. It has been so bad since last year and worse than ever this year.
To my defense I had a lot going on in my personal life last year and now it is all good. I can actually put my time for better use.
I work at one of those big companies. I've haven't been doing well. I know exactly why.
I am an instagram addict. I can't keep my phone away. My attention span is now of a 1 month old child.
I stopped paying attention during meetings because I'm busy zoning out involuntarily. My patience level has gone to zero.
In the beginning of this year, I really wanted to get my shit together and i thought I was turning my life around.
But a really unfortunate mistake I made at work put in a really bad spot. I really had no idea it would blow up very badly. I became infamous for this one mistake. It brought me to my lowest point. Like I am questioning my worth.
I feel like things are bad in general for me. Like not with my partner or anything. But I do anything, think anything it is definitely wrong.
I decide to do something I am wrong. Be it cooking, cleaning, work, planning a trip, choosing clothes or anything else, something for the house, something for the family. Anything, you name it I am wrong. My thoughts are wrong, my way of doing is wrong. I put more salt in food. I am kind of killing the house plants.
The new ones aren't growing.
I try to do something good, it becomes disastrous and creates problems that we never needed.
I stopped doing house chores. My partner is taking care of stuff right now.
I went to the gym for one month and did a rigorous diet that month and lost 8 pounds in one month. And I was told that rate of weight loss is bad. So that thing I thought I'm doing right is wrong.
My way of money management is wrong. I thought I had it all figured out. I'm doing it right. But apparently no. My way could bite us very badly in the future.
There is not one thing going right in my life. Whatever is good is only because of my partner. Because somehow my partner is leading an exactly opposite life.
Doing really well at work. Extremely well. House chores. Self control at its best. Gym, diet. Everything perfectly scheduled and being implemented.
Everything is at its best I should say. But me. Oh god.

I'm scared I'll turn into a 100% good for nothing person if I keep this going. I'm going to lose my mind if I don't see some good results.

"Should I even go to college","I want to go to college, and my family supports me, but I‚Äôm worried about two big things: money and whether my academic record is good enough.

I go to a top-ranked high school in my state, but my extracurriculars and course load don‚Äôt reflect that. I started high school dreaming of becoming an animator, but once I realized how risky and unpredictable that career path is, I switched to medicine. That change caught me off guard.

I didn‚Äôt understand the importance of AP classes until late sophomore year. Up until then, I thought I was doing great‚Äîstraight A‚Äôs in mostly honors classes and a few extracurriculars. But I later realized I wasn‚Äôt building much college credit or showing enough academic rigor. My main activity has been JROTC, which I enjoy, but it gives off a military-focused impression that doesn‚Äôt fit who I am ( I can barely lift my body weight, let alone pass basic training in my current state)

I tried to course-correct by taking more rigorous classes. I planned to take two APs and a dual enrollment English class, but scheduling issues left me with just AP Psychology (which I got a 4 on). Now I‚Äôm a senior, Key Club President, and JROTC‚Äôs Security Officer. But with a 26 on the ACT and limited AP classes so far, I‚Äôm nervous about whether colleges will accept me‚Äîor offer enough financial aid.

My family's middle class. My mom‚Äôs a secretary, and my dad's an HVAC tech. They‚Äôre divorced, and though they‚Äôre hopeful I‚Äôll get financial aid (merit and need).

I‚Äôm scared I won't or it won't be enough. I‚Äôm loading up on APs this year to try to improve my chance of admission.

If anyone has advice on how to move forward this year, I‚Äôm open to it.

My dream schools are Howard (administration issues aside) and UNC (but I'm out of state in Louisiana, so that's kind of a pipe dream)","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m7qonl/should_i_even_go_to_college/","1753318798.0","college","KingRickeyReddit"
"My Sister is Homeless and I Am Not.","I‚Äôm (M23) writing this on my older sister‚Äôs birthday, she‚Äôs just now turned 34 and she is either currently or at-risk of being homeless. My sister was living with my Mom for the past few months before past/current grievances with each other soured the situation until it became too much for either of them to handle and my sister got kicked out. To my sister‚Äôs point, I can see how my Mom could be responsible for childhood trauma. But my mom has mellowed out over the years, and I‚Äôve come to know her more as a person than just a parent. In the convos I‚Äôve had with my mom I could tell she was genuinely helping her out by offering her a place (\~600 sq ft) to stay with her dogs and even allowing her to use her spare car.¬†

Things snowballed fast, when my mom went to visit her home country after getting her green card. She was gone for about a month and a half. About a week before my Mom was to return, I got a phone call from my Mom who told me that my sister wasn‚Äôt answering her calls either because something bad happened (my sister has a few mental illnesses she has told our family about and accuses my mom for causing them) or that she was trying to hide that the apartment was ‚Äú*un desastre*.‚Äù I usually don‚Äôt like it when my mom tasks me with things on the spot, but I was also worried something might have happened to her, so I went over. There I found my sister talking loudly on the phone with my mom (my mom threatened to call the police if she didn‚Äôt answer the phone and let me inside the apt) and was angry at my mom for making her late to work (my mom got mixed up with the different time zones). I told my mom to call back later because my sister proved she was still alive. My sister gave me a ride home because she suspected my mom might have caused her to lose her job.¬†

This was the first time seeing the car that my mom kept fairly neat, it was filled to the brim with dog toys, crumpled paper, things glued to the dash and steering wheel, dog hair, and you name it. We would later find that the car carpet(?) was ripped from the steering wheel to the backseat. In the car, my sister told me that the apartment was a mess. She'd been grieving the loss of a friend, but that friend‚Äôs husband was going to help her clean the apartment the next day. At this point I hadn‚Äôt talked to my sister in a while, but I said I could come over and help her clean, just in case the guy is too busy grieving and can‚Äôt make it.

When I came over, I brought my vacuum, some gloves, and a good attitude that I was there to help and not lecture ( Hoarders is one of my favorite shows and so I tried to replicate the strategies they try to teach). I figured if I helped her clean without my mom knowing how much of a mess there was it would save my mom‚Äôs blood pressure and my sister from getting kicked out (no harm no foul?). However, when I walked in there I was hit with a pretty gnarly smell coming from the dogs, the sink, dirty laundry, and joints smoked in the apt. Anything that could be used to eat off of or with was piled in the sink and countertops. My mom let my sister stay in the living room and gave her full use of the front door closet, (which I was surprised by how large it was) but her clothes sort of avalanched from the various tubs she was using to store them in and made it hard to access the door. In addition to all this, the guy she was seeing (I‚Äôll refer to him as Robby) was there. My mom doesn‚Äôt like this guy over because she doesn‚Äôt know him, gets bad vibes, and feels like he is using my sister for a place to crash (he didn‚Äôt have a place either).

After going to the store to get cleaning supplies (my sister didn‚Äôt mention running out of everything and that she was ‚Äúbroke atm‚Äù and would pay me back) I cleaned for a long time and tried hard to not say a criticism. Robby stepped out to ‚Äúdo a job real quick‚Äù or something, and came back to see moved things (tables shifted to vacuum, his tools and box now on the ground and not on the couch, and my sister‚Äôs clothes in the process of being sorted). The closet avalanche sorting was especially messy. My sister has primarily black clothes and a lot of costume stuff (? she likes boudoir or something) and as I was sorting the black dirty clothes with no dog hair from the black dirty clothes with dog hair (almost all had dog hair because they were on the floor) Robby came back. The man who was there and did not help walked in the front door and said, ‚ÄúWow, I didn‚Äôt expect this place to be a disaster when I came back.‚Äù I was kind‚Äôve flabbergasted and asked him, ‚ÄúWhatdoyoumean by that?‚Äù Neither my sister or Robby answered, but pretty soon after that I realized I blew it because each time I tried cleaning it seemed to overwhelm my sister who told me that I had helped a lot, and that she could do the rest herself in the next two days before our mom came back to the states.¬†

The apartment was not cleaned, my mom found out about the car (it took me a full day breakfast-midnight to clean it) took it away from her (my mom figured my sister or the guy was using it to deal and didn‚Äôt want the car to get impounded), and offered a deal to her. That she could stay until the lease ended (2 more months) and didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, she just couldn‚Äôt smoke in the house, needed to pick up after herself, and couldn‚Äôt have the guy over. This was because my sister needed surgery for her hands (nerve damage from several attempts) so that she could continue to work in the future. I‚Äôm not sure if my sister took up the offer, or if my mom overhyped her offer, but my sister doesn‚Äôt have her job anymore (she claims my mom made her lose her job).

My sister couldn‚Äôt meet the expectations, and also the guy, Robbie, wouldn‚Äôt leave and actively ignored my mom. Frustrated, my mom tried to kick her out but my sister basically started squatting in the apt with the dogs and the guy who wouldn‚Äôt leave (she said the dogs and Robbie are the people who have done the most for her). It turned very quickly into a series of cartoonishly petty fights between my mom and my sister. A month-or-so and several occasions of my mom finding dog poo inside in the potted plants later, my sister with nowhere to go moved into a storage unit with Robby (This didn‚Äôt happen quickly and is another story entirely).

Reader, if you are on the kinder-side you might be asking why I haven‚Äôt offered her my place. I did a few years ago when she was in a similar predicament, I got the OK from my partner (23 at the time) to let her stay in the living room for a few months. At the time, it was summer and she had two dogs and two cats. I explained that we didn‚Äôt have space for her pets, we have a very nervous cat (takes medicine for it). I had a convo with her about finding an apartment with enough space for dogs and how she needs to get herself right first, possibly working out something with a kennel or staying with friends. She said okay. But when my mom drove to my apartment¬† (she drove to the state and back for her) they didn‚Äôt get out of the car even though I could see them parked in the lot. Eventually, I went down to see if it really was them, was greeted by mom and sister with hugs who stepped out of the car. As the car door opened I saw her two dogs in the car. It was the one boundary that I set for my sister and communicated repeatedly. I‚Äôm not sure if I can name the emotion I felt at that moment. If I said yes, I risked my relationship with my partner, my own economic security, and likely an unsafe environment for my own pet. If I said no, I risked upsetting my sister, destroying our relationship as siblings, and generally turning into a colder person.¬†

I selfishly told her no. I had to tell her to her face that I couldn‚Äôt let the dogs stay, and she said (either there or later, and then frequently) that she‚Äôd rather be dead than give up her dogs. She stopped texting me after that, but still venmo requested me money for food (which I fulfilled the best I could, until I found out my brother was getting the same ones but to him she was asking for ‚Äúfood for the dogs.‚Äù My brother, who I have not mentioned, has his own reasons and I don‚Äôt want to misrepresent his point of view. Those were really the only interactions I had with her (her life went on, mine did too, she came to my graduation when that happened, had other problems I heard about through the grapevine).

Right now, things are not dissimilar. I am still in school, living off a grad-school stipend that is dwindling as the school year approaches. I have two cats now, and my partner and I are renting a house, or rather, my partner is (he pays for more than half the rent because grad school does not pay a lot). I have even more space, but I still can‚Äôt take the dogs. My sister has changed a lot since three years ago, and my partner has noticed. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the dogs that are influencing how he feels about allowing her to stay over, but everything that has happened since. I can‚Äôt say that I feel much differently. I‚Äôve told myself that we are trying to not enable her, but it is getting much harder to do.¬†

After the storage unit moved in, she said things are going even more downhill. She wanted to borrow my mom‚Äôs car to move her stuff from the unit. I told her mom would kill me and it‚Äôs not my car to let others borrow (my mom dropped the car off at my place so that she didn‚Äôt do anything to it). My sister told me it was the least our Mom could do for her. After another few messages she begged for it again, so that she could put her stuff in the car and live in it for a while. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, I sent her a long message saying how I felt like we had been enabling her etc. I tried to, but I just couldn‚Äôt mince my words.

My sister didn‚Äôt reply but the next day I saw her walking by on the ring doorbell. Then, the day after that my partner saw her on our street. She didn‚Äôt go up to the door, but sort of walked by, looked at my door, and continued to push a cart and her two dogs.

Yesterday, my partner and I had just gotten home from the grocery store when we heard the doorbell. Funny enough, it was the one day we decided to charge our ring doorbell. I opened the door because I thought it was my mom who lives nearby, and who I missed a call from earlier. No, it was my sister who asked if she could come in. My brain sort of short-fired, I was expecting a visit from her eventually but was still caught off guard. It didn‚Äôt feel unnatural to invite her in, and I thought maybe she had come to talk about her situation. I was stunned by her appearance that I felt myself go on auto-pilot. Her skin was so tanned and sun-burnt, her clothes smelled, and even when she was chuckling about something her eyes looked so scared. I offered her some food I was eating, and brought my fan over when she asked for one.¬†

She asked if she could charge her laptop and connect to the internet, she told me her phone got smashed (I still don‚Äôt know how). I set the internet up for her as she told me how Robby disappeared on her. She was over for only 15 minutes, mostly trying to tell me how she had been asleep for 4 days (she didn‚Äôt explain when I asked her to elaborate). I didn‚Äôt know what to do or what she planned on doing, so I made sure I had the car key in my pocket.¬†

When I put the key in my pocket I realized that my heart was sinking. That for the first time, I was scared of my sister, not just scared for her. After she had left, I honestly felt relieved, and then guilty about my relief, and then frustration towards her, and also anger at myself for having the privilege to look away and convince myself I am not responsible for her. I am not sure which emotion I feel the most.¬†

Today I missed a ring notification from her. At the time, I was in my office writing and sometimes to make myself concentrate I put my phone in the other room. It helps sometimes. When I saw the notification, I almost started crying when I saw her again. It is her birthday which I have been thinking about all day, but have no idea what message I could possibly send to her. When I opened the alert I saw her waiting at the door. I can‚Äôt even watch the full footage because I know there‚Äôs a point in the video where she realizes no one is coming to open the door. There was a point in all this, even just a few weeks ago where I thought if she found a place for the dogs we could offer her a place to crash. Now I don‚Äôt know and it makes me feel disgusted with myself, which upsets me even more for how focused I am about myself. But I am scared and don‚Äôt know how to handle this. Am I doing it all wrong? Please be nice to my sister, it is a long story and she of course did not contribute her own input to reflect her own side. I don't know how I should feel or what to do anymore.

"Feeling super anxious about going back to school‚Ä¶ did I make the wrong choice?","Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 21 (F) and could really use some honest thoughts.

Last year, I flunked out of my pre-med course. There was a lot going on‚Äîmy dad kicked my brother and me out, and between that and everything else, I just couldn‚Äôt keep up with school. I ended up getting a minimum-wage job and renting my own place, thinking I could figure things out on my own.

After a year of that, I decided to try again. My grandparents (who live 15 hours away) offered to let me live with them so I could go back to school, and I said yes. My flight is booked, I‚Äôm enrolled again in pre-med, and everything is set. But now that it‚Äôs only a month away‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm freaking out.

I‚Äôm scared. Last year, the course felt so hard. I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôll go back and just‚Ä¶ not get it. Like I‚Äôll fail all over again. I‚Äôm also really sad to leave. My friends, my independence, my life‚Äîeverything I know is here. I feel like I‚Äôm walking away from it all.

I‚Äôll be 22 in December, and a part of me just wants to travel and live life while I‚Äôm still young and adventurous. But then I think: I need money and education to live the life I want, right? I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. My grandparents are also super strict, so I‚Äôm nervous about that too.

"Should I go on an out-of-state mission trip or take the August SAT?","I‚Äôm stuck deciding between going on a mission trip (out-of-state, likely a great experience) or staying home to take the August SAT. I‚Äôve been studying all summer and don‚Äôt want that work to go to waste.

That said, there¬†*is*¬†a September SAT on the 13th‚Äîjust a \~3-week difference from the August 23rd test. So I technically wouldn‚Äôt be skipping the SAT entirely, just pushing it back a bit.

The dilemma:

* I‚Äôve been consistently prepping for the August SAT. I've been going to SAT classes, and I‚Äôm worried losing momentum (or trying to study while traveling) could tank my performance. Especially because I would be in the first 2 weeks of school for the September SAT so likely would have other stuff on my plate
* On the other hand, the mission trip is something I genuinely care about and would be meaningful (plus probably good extracurricular experience). I've been going for the past two years and I'm a rising junior, so I feel like going again creates consistency

Would love advice from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar boat. Is it worth delaying the SAT and risking a bit of study decay? Or should I just skip the trip and get the test done while its still fresh in my memory

1. Integrated math 2: B (both semesters)
2. AP seminar: A (both semesters - 3 on exam)
3. NGSS Biology: A first semester, B+ second  semester)

I had 7 classes the last 2 years becuase I signed up for earlier bird (0 period), but it‚Äôs not available for juniors and seniors, so I will only have 6 classes moving forward. I believe my current high school GPA is like 3.95?‚Ä¶

My junior year will look like this: 

1. AP US history
2. Chemistry P (normal chemistry not NGSS, only NGSS was an option previously)
3. AP Biology
4. AP Lang
5. Integrated Math 3
6. Symphonic band

Tomorrow is the last day of a summer French course I am doing at Diablo valley college, I‚Äôm currently at an 88% but it might jump up I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs equal to 2 years of high school study and is 5 credits.

Extra curriculars:

1. Marching band (which is required if you are in symphonic band, it sucks so bad)
2. Guitar lessons (not stellar at it, still beginning)
3. Piano lessons (from the same guy as guitar lessons, and we really only do guitar now‚Ä¶)

My goals have switched a lot, originally I wanted to be a therapist so I thought psychology but I have a new found passion for engineering, so I currently want to pursue mechanical engineering but that‚Äôs just for now at least. I know I am in no way stellar, but that‚Äôs not gonna stop me from trying. I think legacy applicant can help, I know I‚Äôd have to apply ED.

"PSA to THOSE Engineering Students: you're not the only one who has hard classes","I just had this quick interaction on TikTok, and saw this reply to my comment (I'm always online when I'm not in class, and I don't really have a lot of notifs, so I saw it immediately) and wanted to share my thoughts here.

For context, in Senior High School, I was in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Strand (it's one of the specialized 11th-12th grade programs in the Philippines for those who don't know). I found our engineering, physics, chem, and calculus subjects very hard. All this to say, I somewhat understand that superiority complex they have because as STEM students, our teachers told us the same things and we were in a similarly structured environment as engineering students. I, admittedly, also had a superiority complex as a STEM student which I've slowly gotten better from when I made friends and connected with people outside of STEM and now that I'm in college.

Anyway, now I'm an accountancy student.

At least for me, both engineering and accounting topics are quite difficult in different aspects (i might just be dumb and lazy when it comes to studying tho). I'm somewhat proficient in using formulas which is good for some aspects of STEM subjects, as well as long problem solving, which is good for some accounting activities. Both are very hard for me still, all things considered.

Some of my closest high school friends who are in engineering courses now, I've been fine with and I've never heard/seen them act like they're superior towards other courses that are not STEM-aligned because we're all mutually suffering in college regardless of our course. 

But there are apparently some engineering students that have some sort of superiority complex and think they're better than everyone just because of what they study?

Like, I'm sorry you're suffering in your course, but I'm suffering in mine too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"story time","My best friend has always been the perfect one‚Äîsomeone who was against online friends and quite introverted. Let‚Äôs call her *Cupcake*.

After our 10th board exams, Cupcake was going through the comment section of her favorite influencer when she came across a comment from a guy she really liked. Let‚Äôs call him *Marshmallow*. She followed him right away.

Marshmallow didn‚Äôt accept her request on the first day, but on the second day, he did‚Äîand he was the one who started the conversation. Cupcake was really excited that a guy had texted her first, so without thinking much, she replied. Slowly, their conversation grew. Marshmallow was from a different state and a year younger than her. They started talking all day long, and after 5 PM, they would talk again at 9:30 every night.

Cupcake started getting attached, especially because she was talking to a guy for the first time. Marshmallow had recently gotten out of a relationship, so their vibes really matched.

One day, while Cupcake was telling him about some incidents from her life, Marshmallow suddenly said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to her. That phrase slowly became common between them, and they started calling each other by sweet nicknames. Cupcake fell in love with Marshmallow‚Äîand he said he loved her too. Although they never officially dated due to the distance, Cupcake was madly in love with him.

Then one day, Marshmallow told Cupcake that he liked another girl. After saying all that, he still ended the conversation with ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù which was really not okay. Cupcake cried a lot that day‚Äîit made my blood boil, but I couldn‚Äôt do anything.

A month or two later, Marshmallow told Cupcake that they should stop doing the things they used to do because he cared for her and knew she loved him. He felt it would be best to create some distance. But every time Marshmallow tried to act mature and pull away, Cupcake would try to bring things back to how they used to be because she was scared of losing him. And each time, they‚Äôd end up going back to their lovey-dovey dynamic.

What Cupcake doesn‚Äôt realize is that Marshmallow knows his priorities. Deep down, he knows that nothing serious can happen between them. But Cupcake isn‚Äôt ready to believe that. She still hopes that someday, everything will fall into place.

So, do you think Marshmallow actually loves her? Or should I try once again to help Cupcake understand the reality of the situation?

(Also, the guy is genuinely very sweet and takes really good care of Cupcake.)","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1m7uhmm/story_time/","1753330062.0","highschool","LaalPariiii"

"UGH!!! My high school-self fucked me over with one email account!","Okay, Okay... not as dramatic as it looks, but..

(if you want a sappy recollection of my past mistakes, if not just skip below)
Well, when I was younger I very much did not care about my online security, I mean I nothing crazy happened to me, I never got scared or got trucked into meeting a creep. I was actully quite home bodied as a teen.
But now in my growing adulthood, I know now how easy it is to steal information, and now I am worried about how much of my self is out their.
And... I vividly remember using my old email carelessly... like full name... I used my freaking name online. I was carful, making sure to never out my self as a minor, have minimal info and ask my parents for help.
But I just know their are a dozen or so websites that have my information. I nolonger use that account anymore, but still have it in the background, and it kills me everything I see it and how much I just didn't care about my online security.

(So now onto my real question)
Does anyone know how to check your history for sites you have previously signed in with a Google email account. like checking out everything you have ever signed into on Google. I know they have their password manager but that is not what I am looking for. I plan on eliminating my old childhood account, scrubbing the data and tracking down any info that might be important so I can switch search browsers with as much of a paper trail removed.

And I've just drawn the conclusion that it's way too many possibilities for me to risk it, and l actually find it quite selfish that people are having hella children during this time of such uncertainty, especially the ones who have kids bos of ""legacy"" reasons like the avg person even has a legacy to begin with ... & genuinely don't understand why society pushes having children on women and young girls so much, why not shift that to them prioritizing their career and things that would allow their potential kids to have a good life LATER on in life.

I hardly attended 1st semester and in the start of January I had to have a surgery for pilonidal sinus and then again in may for laser surgery because it relapsed. Throughout this time college made my life liv√≠ng hell. They were inhumane and so inconsiderate..

I am currently taking a drop and wanted to join a college next year but to be honest I never really wanted to join college ever since class 10th I didn't.
The sole reason I joined that college was FOMO and a hope that I might end up making friends (I never had any friends throughout my life). My school life was soo bad that I don't feel any nostalgia and stuff..
My family has been really supportive of my decision. Infact my mother keeps saying to pursue a degree from open or a college where I just have to give exams so I can pursue any skills and multiple hobbies I have. I am really into learning different fields and subject since childhood (Polymath) and I love learning new language (Polyglot).
After my recent experience with health setback,I wish to start running and swimming too.

I am really grateful for my mother and how supportive she is but I get scared.
I have ADHD so it's hard for me to be consistent and stuff and I am afraid that I will end up not having any social life.
I know my mother is right that I am given a choice to not be in rat race and actually pursue different fields and different skills instead of sitting in college from 9 to 5(which my ADHD brains hate so much).

I am positive that after few courses and living here and there throughout the 3 years while I side by side pursue college degree will be good for me..

But i am slightly unsure. I have been bedrotting from past 7 month's and have huge scrolling addiction since 4 years I guess 
I would really love some advice as I am really stuck and depressed..","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m84y6h/need_some_advice/","1753365000.0","college","Traditional-Worth193"

"How ""good"" do you have to be to pursue STEM?","I'm a rising Junior rn and I'm thinking of what to major in 
Throughout HS and Middle School I genuinely thought I was going to be pursuing STEM all the way through - but rn I'm having self-doubts

My stronger points are English, History, and stuff in that area (hypocritical ik) but I get burnt out easily and I'm more inclined to doing STEM work when I get older

Between Math and Science, my science is definitely better and I like doing more lab work than doing math - amongst my grades, my lowest is math

Can I still genuinely have a chance at STEM if I work on my math before applying or am I done for? I know I'm definitely not for something like Engineering with my current level right now but do I still have a chance? 

Also how's college life doing STEM or other majors?

"It's time to move and find land -- but how?","I'm 27F, USA, have lived with my parents again for the past few years and ready to take the next step to move and gain my independence. I honestly have just began gaining credit, I have a very small savings nest, and I'm an artist finally getting out there. I have thought about going back to school but currently unsure where I would want to finish my degree (maybe I could live on campus but that isn't my desire). 

My history with renting: I have only moved in with my ex boyfriend -- and he took most of the responsibility and didn't really explain to me what was going on. I can't really afford anywhere where I live in the city like most Americans. I cannot do a roommate situation as I have no local friends and every roommate attempt ended in absolute chaos and prolonging my stay at home. 

I want to do this myself but I don't know the steps to find... maybe like a small plot of land that I could maybe put a trailer on or just tiny living! I don't need much space, I would just like a yard good enough for homesteading. I love the idea of being in a rural place, I have no problems with living alone, and I know how to protect myself.

I originally plan on applying for Spring 2026, but I am delaying for Fall 2026. I have not given grace for myself at all. Ever since I graduated from high school, I constantly go to school. I graduate with my associate of science, transferred to a university, and later dropped out to transfer back to a community college. 

I am eligible for tuition assistance from the program, but I may be off of the list because I haven‚Äôt enrolled in any classes (because I couldn‚Äôt due to already completing all of my pre-requisites and unqualified for FAFSA due to many credit hours).

I still want to be a nurse, at the end of the day, but I am unable to support myself if I go through this. I will be unable to pay off debt, rent, and etc. I am a first-generation and I only had myself to rely on.

Family starts expecting return on investment, you start overthinking what your future will look like, you start thinking ""oh I am getting old, by now I should have been a millionaire as planned 10 years ago"" üòÇ.

I had dreams growing up (I am 20), you know and I did everything ""right"". I studied well in school, got into a great college, am studying my butt off- and I know no one is entitled to anything. However, even doing everything by the book has cooked us. 

The one dream I had (being a soccer player) has passed me up and all I see now is a life of corporate slavery, chained to a 9 to 5 if there even will be a job (!). I am actively losing it every single day, get home and all I can do is sleep. 

AI is going to take over every job, and even if it doesn't take my job, society is cooked and therefore I am cooked. The rich want us to die off, inequality is higher than ever, climate change (WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT CLIMATE CHNAGE), water/food shortages, dumb-brained politics. 

I really don't see a world where things work out. And yes every generation had their ""thing"", the difference here is that so many ""things"" have to be resolved and go right and that's not gonna happen.

I wanted a life where I'd get a nice big home, retire my immigrant parents, have kids. But who in their right mind would have kids just for them to be cooked. 

I have began resenting my own parents for choosing to have me, which I know is unfair. 

I know complaining doesn't do anything, but it's tough out there as all of you know. I have completely given up hope and dropped the ball on life, no drive, aspirations, meaning, just living day by day until it all collapses.

"Taking a Semester Off‚Ä¶","Taking a Semester Off

Hey all.

I‚Äôve recently come face-to-face with the very likely fact that I may need to take a semester off to work and save myself financially and emotionally from ‚Äúadulting.‚Äù

‚ÄîContext‚Äî

I (25 now) am something of an unwilling super-senior who, by merit of having a severe seizure disorder in my early 20‚Äôs, had his college plans delayed for nearly 4 years (I did online courses off and on until we found a solution to my health).

Not only did this set me back from all of my friends whom I graduated high school with, it also set me back financially. And even though I have been seizure free for two years I am still clawing my way out of the financial struggles that came with my ‚Äúseizure arc.‚Äù The biggest of which has been affording college on my own, and struggling to save enough left over to secure a vehicle, among other things. I am largely financially independent.

‚ÄîExtra Stuff‚Äî

In any case after being denied student loan options from every major lender in my state, I‚Äôm finding myself at a loss regarding how I‚Äôll manage to afford the fall semester.

I have a feeling that even if I do manage to find a lender or scrounge enough money to make the fall semester happen, I‚Äôll be psychologically crushed and still without transportation. I can‚Äôt afford to lose more time but, more than that I can‚Äôt afford to jeopardize my grades because I intend to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree and do medical research.

‚Äî‚ÄîClosing Questions‚Äî‚Äî

In any case, I apologize for the word wall of context- I just needed to write this all out. My ultimate point with all of this was to perhaps spark discussion and ask you all for any advice, suggestions, or just personal experiences with navigating a delayed college experience due to unforeseen circumstances, or if you‚Äôve taken a semester or two off.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m8khqp/taking_a_semester_off/","1753401850.0","college","Azuri-Os"
"Career Path Concerns","Hi,

I‚Äôm currently considering switching my college major and minor‚Äîfrom majoring in Elementary Education with double minors in Music and African American Studies to majoring in Psychology with a minor in Education. I‚Äôve always wanted to become an elementary school teacher, whether as a general education teacher or a music teacher. However, lately, I‚Äôve been second-guessing this path because I‚Äôm worried about the pay.

I truly see myself teaching and working with young children‚Äîit‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about. I also love music, which is why I chose to minor in it. I added African American Studies because I genuinely enjoy learning about Black history, culture, and contributions. But even with all that passion, I can‚Äôt ignore the concern about financial stability. That‚Äôs what led me to start researching alternative career paths, particularly becoming a Child Psychologist.

As I looked into it more, I realized that working with children in a psychological and emotional support role also aligns with my interests. It still allows me to make a difference in their lives, just in a different setting. I‚Äôm reaching out for insight‚Äîbased on what I‚Äôve shared, do you think switching to Psychology might be a better fit long-term, or is there a way to balance my passion for teaching with financial security?

I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts.

I will never forget that moment. It wasn‚Äôt just about the music. It was about love, faith, family, and being seen‚Äîtruly seen‚Äîby the person I admire most. Since that day, I have never stopped playing the keyboard. Every time I play, especially in church, I see my father watching me from the pews, smiling with pride. And every time, I remember that night.

My father taught me more than how to play music. He taught me patience, dedication, and what it means to believe in someone. I had shown interest in learning, and he was committed to helping me succeed‚Äînot just for my sake, but because he wanted us to play together. In just two weeks, I was already playing fluently. Around that same time, we found out that the church‚Äôs keyboard player had left. During the next service, the pastor said she had been praying for a replacement. My father turned to me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to train you even more so you can help.‚Äù But in the very next service, I was already on stage, playing with the worship team.

I was nervous, but I felt ready‚Äînot only because I had practiced, but because someone believed in me. That faith, that love, and that encouragement shaped me. From that day on, music became a part of my identity and my way of serving others. My father‚Äôs pride and trust gave me confidence that I still carry into every challenge I face.

Beyond music, my father has always inspired me to study and grow. He encouraged me to learn English, and he is the reason I dream of studying abroad and becoming a doctor. He never pushed me with pressure, only with belief.

That Christmas Eve changed my faith and my idea of family. Since then, we‚Äôve been more active in church, and our home has become a place of more intentional connection and communion. ‚ÄúNingu√©m Explica Deus‚Äù became our song, and even now, every time we hear or play it together, we both feel that same emotion all over again. Sometimes we still cry, but it‚Äôs always tears of gratitude.

I am grateful for many things in my life, but this moment‚Äîthis memory‚Äîis a piece of who I am. It taught me what it means to love, to be loved, and to carry that love through action, music, faith, and purpose.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m8m52h/can_you_help_me_review_my_common_app_essay/","1753406541.0","ApplyingToCollege","Technical_Draft_3799"
"Really stressed about my new job and I cant tell anyone about it","I live in a city where everyone works for the same hospital, including all of my friends. I have a really cool job starting in September and I'm really stressed about it. My new position is as a field service engineer, it's fully remote/travel only within my state, about a 30% raise, salary, and im so excited and stress but I have to pretend it doesn't exist. I cant put in my notice until late August because of a sign on bonus I accepted last year, and im working a job that I don't really like and I have to talk like I'm planning on being here for years.

It's a really good move and it's going to allow me to move to a bigger city where I'll be happier. I extended my lease for only 3 months since I didn't know if I'd get the job or not, so I have enough time to move. I'll be getting roommates with a few other people who travel for work so I'll be renting a really nice house for pretty cheap. 

It's a really good situation and im so happy and excited, but I have to internalize all of it. I can't even tell my family since they know my boss and have a lot of friends at the company. It's mentally exhausting. 

It also sucks since I work with 2 other people right now on evening 12s. 1 of them is retiring and the other is transferring departments. Everyone thinks I'm going to be the only person there and theyre preparing for me to work solo since the new hires have to train on day shift until theyre competent. I can't say anything for another month. I feel bad for my coworkers but it's not worth the risk of getting fired early is my boss finds out and having to repay the bonus. I can't move back my start date either.

And im stressed about the culture of my new job. 100% remote sounds cool but now it's really setting in that I'll never actually meet any of my coworkers or bosses, unless we're at a conference together. I'll be travelling on 1 week notice all over the place, driving a ton, and my primary training is in Europe, Massachusetts, and California. It's going to be such a huge change and I just can't risk my support network knowing about it yet.

"On Target Schools and the Job Market:","This was a reply to someone talking about how the modern college degree means nothing. I thought I would post it here to hear your collective thoughts.

>Let me correct you for a second here. College degrees from¬†*non-target state universities*¬†are worth nothing right now. If you go to an elite T25 American university, you are essentially isolated from the bad job-market. A company would rather hire someone with a 2.3 GPA who got shitfaced every weekend and on academic probation at a target school than to hire someone who busted their ass off in a local flagship university with internships and relevant experience.

>""Target schools"" are a cheap heuristic to determine someone's worth by hiring departments of large companies who have to review thousands of applications for each job posting. This is a very flawed shortcut because in terms of raw effort, target schools tend to me more grade¬†*inflated*¬†compared to the average college. So, on average, someone who has to go to a prestigious university actually can do better in their classes with less effort. This plus extremely small class sizes, and an endowment that is typically tenfold bigger than the average college, you get students who have to barely lift a finger to get any sort of job.

>In a more systemic lens, we can look at PMC jobs are a transfer of a parent's social class from one generation to another. They have always been superfluous by nature. With the advent of economic downturn, AI, and the fact that desk-jobs can't linearly grow with population, means that less of these jobs are available relative to the population. These jobs become infinitely more competitive, and a problem that was before a mild annoyance becomes completely debilitating for anyone trying to find a job.

>Naturally, to protect their own class interests, those at T25 universities (typically those in the upper class of petit-bourgeois or sons of capital owners), give those jobs away to those in their alumni network or within their respected caste/social circle. PMC jobs will always exist, but they will only exist to serve our upper class as the circular justification for their own position.

>Admission to these colleges are typically indirectly class indicators as well, I hope I don't have to browbeat you about this fact since it's been drilled into our minds already through so many¬†*Atlantic*¬†and¬†*NYT*¬†articles with that same thesis.

>For examples for where the job market will go, look at the white-collar job markets in places like tier 1-2 city China or South Korea.

"Is UC Merced on the same level as UMass Amherst?","I know UC Merced gets a lot of shit from here for being the least prestigious UC, (atleast, until UC Bakersfield becomes a thing,) but I‚Äôve been interested in it. I‚Äôd describe myself as an above average student, 3.7 GPA, full IB, but I also want to try and get through undergrad as debt-free as possible. As an Oregon resident, I have access to the WUE program which would massively reduce the cost of going to UCM, the only UC on that list.

I‚Äôm trying to find a good balance of prestige and cost, as me and my family can‚Äôt afford schools like UW or UMich without a huge scholarship. I‚Äôve fallen in love with WSU‚Äôs campus, which seems to have some prestige and an attainable cost of attendance, which also would have a good path into UW for grad school (hopefully.)

Higher than the former ‚Äúworst‚Äù UC‚ÄîRiverside, higher than my state‚Äôs flagship, UO. I‚Äôm looking to go into a medical field, probably studying biology, so some prestige in a school does matter to me.

"this is absolutely ridiculous and i need help/advice","So I attend an HBCU and happen to be majoring in Electrical Engineering. I managed to fail three classes in Fall24 for Physics lab and lecture and calculus 2 after previously never failing a class in life - and to be frank - i dont want to hear anything unless you‚Äôve been in a stem major or something similar.

Anyway, i retook physics and got an A in both classes because I got professors that actually felt like doing their job. I haven‚Äôt been able to register for Calculus 2 until this summer , because my uni denied me permission to take a calc class at an online accredited university and I couldnt get into ones at any close community colleges. (and even if i did im certain theynwould deny me)

They dropped me from the calculus class due to nonpayment, I was unaware I didnt have another loan to cover the balance. i am unfamiliar with how loans work, and i quickly got approved for a loan that would cover the balance that they told me was ‚Äú6064 USD‚Äù (my loan was 6100). They approved my loan at my uni, but they did not get back to me about my class being reinstated.

They now are actually saying I wasnt dropped due to administrative action and I dropped it voluntarily before i attended the class/started it which is absolute horseshit. This summer class was asynchronous and had no zoom meetings. They also said I still have a balance of 400 or so USD. (They said after the class is dropped I wont see what I actually owe and I have to ask them directly so I have no way of knowing my real ‚Äúbalance‚Äù)

I‚Äôm frankly enraged. Is there a way I can cancel the loan I put out with my parents to cover what I owed for the summer?

Also are there any community colleges or universities in Maryland, New York, or in between that offer my major without absolutely robbing me? I‚Äôm strongly considering withdrawing from my university if that is at all possible because I‚Äôm spending way too much money for these people to send interns to have me jump through hoops like a circus monkey. i just don‚Äôt want to be broke forever.

"Theres so many events and very little support","Hi, I'm a graduating student in highschool and also our school's student body president. Being president of the student body has always been something that I wanted to do. And I knew even back then that the title had many responsibilities and things that they needed to do. But I'm just so stressed kasi almost every month may event, and I have little support from the school. Me and my members (well, 3 or 4 of them atleast) have been using our money to fund the designs and whatnot, that we do for an event. And I've been trying to fix this, since we're using our money that we should be using for our snacks or money that we'vesaved for ourselves. I've recommended US running a fundraiser in school (since they don't really allow us to do school activities outside since it's dangerous) and even doing a solicitation on parents or gpta officers. But they didn't agree. And I could somehow understand why because no.1 they said running a fundraiser would slow down the sales they get from their cafeteria tat they use to feed teachers (since our fundraiser was selling snacks, like homemade snacks that I made every night), and no.2 parents just had a recent project for the school classrooms, etc. BUT I would've understood if expectations weren't so damn high, they said it had to be ""simple"" and ""fire"".... we can't do that with almost no money. And they did say that we should just ask them and the other students for materials, but students haven't given us anything even after we put up lists of what we needed, and they are very hard to ask for things since they're either stingy, in a bad mood (and when they're in a bad mood, everything is just wrong for them one way or another), or they're busy. And if your lucky to catch them in a good mood, then that's good. But its so hard that way, and its lowkey very unprofessional. So now I'm stressed because now I'm broke, there's so many events left, there's an event next month AGAIN, designs for nutrition month still isn't finished with the lack of materials, and I'm a graduating student who hasn't prioritized their studies yet.

"Adulting - A Perspective","Look. It doesn't matter if times were easier 20 years ago, it doesn't help you to yearn for it. All you have is right now and an indeterminate future.

What can you do - my ten thoughts.

1. Invest prudently in yourself. No need to go $100k in debt for college or post grad (unless you're going to be an MD). Choose a degree that will be useful and, if you can, avoid disciplines that AI will take over. Also, there are many courses that will help progress your career, it doesn't have to be a degree.

2. Try to live within your means. I know it's hard but, sit down with a spreadsheet and net your incomings and outgoings. The surplus can be saved but, don't forget to have some life too. Tomorrow isn't promised. And when you're in the old people's home, the memories you make as a young person will make being old bearable. If you don't have a surplus, figure out how to reduce your outgoings and increase your incomings. Easier said than done, I know!

3. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Know who your allies are who will help. Cultivate those relationships with offers of support, help and kindness are a two way street.

4. Marriage is hard sometimes. Unless you're married to a jerk, remember, most arguments come from a place of good intent.

5. Kids are on loan to you. Treasure your time with them. Spend as much time with them as you possibly can do that when they're older, the parental relationship becomes a friendship. Don't be afraid to say no though!

6. There are words of power. Use them wisely.
Yes - the opening of possibilities.
No - the setting of boundaries.
Home - sanctuary and identity.
Love - (obviously).
These are the four I know. There will be others that matter to you.

7. Be as quick as you can to forgive. Life is too short to hold a grudge. Yes some things are unforgivable but, who used the last of the milk isn't it. Especially people you love.

8. Don't expect life to be amazing all the time but be open for noticing things that offer joy. My most recent was, every light on my way to work was green!

9. Treasure your time. If someone or something is taking more of your time than you want to give, manage it. My work is important to me, I enjoy it but, I don't have anything installed on my phone and I don't bring my laptop home or away on holiday.

10. You matter. Your health matters. Make time to do those health appointments ( obvs without going bankrupt!) especially preventative care. Don't put it off, something trivial may become something non trivial.

I'm scared to drive, so i don't (even though I have my license).

I feel horribly unattractive so I don't date. I don't even try. I mean I can't do online dating because I'm under 6ft and 98% of women filter 6ft> men out immediately. And I don't meet anyone in person or if I do, they're never attracted to me as a person. It is what it is. I haven't had a serious girlfriend since I was 18. I am miserable.

I'm scared to death of rejection even though most of my life has been nothing but a long series of it in all areas. I can barely learn new skills due to ADHD so it's not like if I work hard I'll achieve things. 

I am stuck. I am a child, living the same day over and over.  Nothing about me is respectable and I do not have a shred of respect for myself. I live as if I hate myself.

I had to turn down going to my nieces birthday party out of town this weekend because my only way back is a ride from my mother who likes to drink and drive.  I hate living like this.  I hate not being a real human adult. It sucks but I have no idea how to change or be better.

This process started all the way in the fall months of 2024. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this and didn‚Äôt find out till about a month ish ago. So now I have to commute but the problem is, my mom is the only one with a car. We‚Äôve sorta figured out a plan and it looks all good on paper but I just think it would be more beneficial for me to get a car which my mom disagrees with. She hasn‚Äôt really given me specific reasons just always says that I can just wait till income tax season and she‚Äôll help me and that we have it all figured out already so focus on school. Which I understand but after looking at the way things will play out‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.

First, I‚Äôll have to pay for my part of the insurance which is gonna be about 160. I also have my phone bill which is 76 ish, and gas which isn‚Äôt that bad, her car doesn‚Äôt take more than 20. But I don‚Äôt have a job and even if I get a job, I‚Äôd only be able to work Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays. 

Second, my siblings are also gonna be in school, my school is a 20 minute drive and when my classes start is around the time my siblings get outta school which means as soon as my mom gets off work she‚Äôll have to take me to school early so I may get to class on time.

Third, I know many people don‚Äôt but I‚Äôm almost 20 and there are kids younger than me that have a car. I feel like I‚Äôm falling behind. I see so many benefits behind getting a car but my mom is making me doubt myself extremely. 

I have some money saved up but I‚Äôm waiting to see how much my refund from school will be to help secure a bigger price range so I can actually get a good working car.

"I hate self improvement","I hate the idea of ""improving yourself"" so that you could be worthy of love, of keeping your job, etc. I just want to exist with freedom and minimal stress. This constant rat race makes life not worth living imo. Do monkeys have any desire to improve themselves? No, they want to eat fruit. Self improvement is to me an oppressive idea.

Self improvement for the sake of self improvement is stupid. You are already good enough. You should self improve because it makes you feel good, or improves your life in some way.

What I want, and what I suspect what everyone else wants, is to be loved. Is to be enough. Having to work hard to reach that seems like a grueling marathon.

"(Career Advice Needed) Torn Between Purpose and Income: Holistic Healing, Somatics, and Supporting a Family?","Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm reaching out because I could¬†*really*¬†use some career advice - I‚Äôm in a moment of major (but healthy) career anxiety, and I want to ask for guidance from real people.

I know Reddit can be a little ruthless, and that's okay - I‚Äôm open to tough love, but I‚Äôm mostly looking for sincere, thoughtful, and pragmatic advice from anyone who's been here or knows this path.

**The situation:**

I'm a 26 year old male, living in China right now teaching English. I graduated from an interdisciplinary college where I created my own major:¬†**‚ÄúHolistic Approaches to Healing: Body-Mind-Spirit Integration.‚Äù**¬†Most of my coursework centered around somatic psychology, embodiment, movement, health, and healing.

I‚Äôm passionate about holistic health, somatics, fitness, yoga, nutrition, meditation, ayahuasca/psychedelic work (in moderation), and deep psychological, spiritual, and physical healing. I‚Äôve apprenticed at a Chinese medicine clinic. I was a personal trainer for a year and¬†*loved it*. But like many in the healing arts, I‚Äôm now stuck between what feeds my soul and what will support a future family.

**Why the urgency?**

I recently got engaged to a woman I love deeply. She‚Äôs a med student who‚Äôll graduate in two years. She‚Äôll be an MD, and while I‚Äôm incredibly proud of her, I‚Äôm equally committed to never being financially dependent on her. I want to fully¬†*share the*¬†load of providing, especially if she takes maternity leave or steps back at any point.

Up until now, I‚Äôve been content living modestly as a bachelor with onestly very little responsibilities besides my own finances, health, and saving enough money to travel around. I've worked in restaurants, odd jobs, supplement/health shops and in fitness. But it‚Äôs time for me to choose a career that can realistically support a future: a home, kids, travel, freedom, and security. My minimum goal income is¬†**$120K+**, ideally¬†**up to $200K+ over time**.

**What I‚Äôm drawn to:**

I‚Äôm looking for a path that combines¬†**science + spirit**,¬†**healing + embodiment**, and¬†**financial security + soul purpose**. I want to help people¬†*truly heal*¬†‚Äî emotionally, spiritually, physically ‚Äî at the root cause level. I don‚Äôt believe Western medicine alone is equipped for that (though I respect and admire it).

Some career options I‚Äôm exploring:

**Nurse Practitioner (NP) with a Functional/Integrative Medicine focus**

**Pros:**¬†Offers licensure, strong income potential, broad scope of practice, and the flexibility to eventually open my own clinic.

**Cons:**¬†While it checks the practical boxes, something about it feels a bit out of sync with my core values. I worry that, given my holistic background, I‚Äôll feel out of place in the conventional, rigid clinical model of Western medicine. That said, I wonder if this could be a necessary crucible ‚Äî a rite of passage ‚Äî to gain the credentials and legitimacy needed to later practice in the more integrative, soul-aligned way I envision.

**Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT)**

Pros: Recognized title, stable job

Cons: Debt-to-income ratio, may feel too ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and not holistic enough

**Doctor of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (DAOM)**

Pros: Loved apprenticing in acupuncture, deeply holistic, rich tradition

Cons: Unsure about income potential, especially starting out,

**Somatic Psychotherapist / Jungian-Informed Therapist**

Pros: Feels¬†*most aligned*¬†with my heart and calling

Cons: Licensing route unclear, long journey, possibly lower income

**Hybrid Holistic Practitioner**¬†(e.g. Integrative NP + Somatic Therapy + Psychedelic Guide + Fitness/Nutrition)

Is this even¬†*realistic*¬†to combine into a legit practice?

**What I need help with:**

* Are any of these careers viable for earning $120‚Äì200K while staying deeply true to my mission?
* Has anyone successfully combined spirituality, psychology, fitness, and medicine into a¬†*real*¬†and¬†*profitable*¬†practice? Think like Huberman meets, Gabor mate, meets shipibo healer. Idk...
* Which paths offer¬†**licensure, respect, impact, and income**¬†\- especially if you want to work independently?
* Am I overthinking the income part or underestimating the market for what I love?

**What‚Äôs driving this:**

This isn‚Äôt just about ego or matching my spouse‚Äôs income - it‚Äôs about wanting to build a life with someone I love, and not have to choose between passion and provision. I‚Äôm scared that if I follow my heart, I‚Äôll never make enough money. And if I chase money, I‚Äôll lose my soul.

I‚Äôm tired of trying to figure this out with AI or therapy alone. I‚Äôm ready to get real, take action, and commit - but I need your help to make a smart, aligned, and financially solid decision.

Thank you in advance for reading. Seriously. I welcome any advice, honest reflections, reality checks, or questions.

**Summary:**¬†26M passionate about holistic healing, somatics, fitness, and spirituality. Want to choose a career that‚Äôs both deeply purposeful and can earn $120K+ to support a family alongside my future MD spouse. Torn between NP, DAOM, DPT, somatic psychotherapy, (another career I'm not aware of?), or creating a hybrid role. Looking for real guidance, tough love, or anything in between.

"FRUSTRATED W/ PNB | REMITTANCE FUND ON-HOLD | POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ü§¨","
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm hoping someone here can share insights or advice about an issue I‚Äôm facing with PNB (Philippine National Bank).

My father sent me money via Western Union, and I successfully claimed it into my PNB debit account. I was even able to withdraw part of the amount at the ATM. Then suddenly, I noticed that my account balance became negative ‚Äî which really stressed me out.

When I asked, I was told the reason was an ‚Äúerroneous transfer‚Äù tied to the remittance. They said the funds were placed on hold or reversed. I was asked to deposit back what I withdrew, which I already did to settle it.

I also received a message from PNB saying there was a debit transaction processed over-the-counter at their Overseas Remittance Department. The staff assisting me told me they had already emailed the head office so the funds could be transferred properly ‚Äî but I‚Äôm still waiting.

To make things worse, I‚Äôve been passed around between my account‚Äôs branch, the main branch, and customer service, and none of them have provided a clear answer or real help. It‚Äôs exhausting and frustrating. I feel like no one wants to take ownership of the issue.

I just want my account to be back to normal and to stop dealing with all this stress and confusion.

Has anyone gone through the same thing?
How long does it take for PNB to fix something like this?
And is there a more effective way to escalate this issue?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any help or support would mean a lot. üôè","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m8tx27/frustrated_w_pnb_remittance_fund_onhold_poor/","1753432808.0","Adulting","terixxz"
"Practicality vs desire","I‚Äôve reached the point at which I must decide where I want to focus my application efforts. My end goal is to be accepted into medical school, and though I‚Äôm not sure I have what it takes to get there I am very motivated to try. 

I am a Texas resident, dad makes a lot of money (500k+) and is willing to support me through college and medical school. I do not want to burden him so heavily during my undergrad years that paying for medical school becomes a struggle. 

If I went to UT Austin, which I am very likely to be accepted by, I would pay significantly less than any other college I‚Äôm considering. Plus, it seems to be the highest ranked college I‚Äôm capable of getting into. 

However, I hate Texas. I have lived here for my entire life and I think it fucking sucks. There are good parts and Austin is a fine city, but I am generally depressed by my surroundings. I want to leave. I‚Äôd be willing to go back to Texas for medical school.

Ideally, I would go somewhere in the northwest or Colorado. Thinking UW, Oregon state, UC Boulder

Those colleges are much pricier than UT Austin, though. A difference of maybe 50k just so that I can have my scenic mountain backdrop and pretty trees. I feel as though it would be shitty and selfish of me to ask my father to pay so much more for something that is entirely unnecessary.

The question then is this: would I be better off sucking it up and staying in Texas (financially better, close to home, better school rank), or going PNW/Colorado (prettier, preferable climate, enjoyable outdoors, abortions are legal, expensive)?

And, bonus question: Is it a good idea to get residency elsewhere before beginning medical school applications or should I remain a Texas resident for those? 

Thank you in advance and if there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs had a similar dilemma please lmk what you did, neither of my parents went to college and I do not have a lot in the way of role models.

"Feeling Trapped","VERY LONG POST; Im a Filipino Student hoping for a good education abroad, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Philippine education is okay, but it honestly could be better. It‚Äôs also because I want to restart my life over. I see TikTok and Facebook post of Filipino students getting to school abroad with scholarships, and even one of my closest friends during Grade 7 got into USA. Not going to lie, I felt a pinch in my heart. I keep thinking about, ‚ÄúIt should have been me.‚Äù Over and over again. I also can‚Äôt help but cry. 

Im in a school where it‚Äôs average, but not really great. I have high grades, Im also fearless in leadership, but I can‚Äôt help feel like I should have done more, I feel like I should have been in a place where what I do matters. In the school Im in, our principal fakes a smile, and pretends she does something to the school, but in reality she doesn‚Äôt. All the chairs aren‚Äôt even nice here, broken wooden chairs, and sometimes cutting risks because the metal nail is visible on top of the table. And this schools, only favors Specials, we have so called ‚ÄòSpecial Program in the Arts,‚Äô ‚ÄòSpecial program in Technology and Engineering‚Äô but in reality, they get so burnt out. The schedule for Special‚Äôs is 6:30 AM to 4pm. Insane. I ask myself, ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt they provide better chairs, better tables, better rooms, and better education if they expect us to do better?‚Äô I was one of the programs, but I left because I could barely sleep, eat, and so many lectures, assignments, for what!? And they can‚Äôt even give a reasonable deadline!?

I also can‚Äôt help but be saddened by the situation of the Philippines today, the politicians are so money hungry. The people who are struggling to make ends meet still paying taxes not knowing that they are feeding pigs who want more money. The people who are trying to get food still paying taxes to those pigs that eats expensive shit on their plate.

And I‚Äôm affected, Im one of those people whoa re affected, aware, but also trapped.

I really wanna go abroad and study there, but I also have to consider tuition fees, overall expenses. But how? My parents are 100k in debt, because of my dumb father who got scammed. Fuck. And I feel bad for my mother who is trying to feed us all, and I can‚Äôt help but cry. I feel so trapped. I feel like Im in jail. What did I do wrong?

It reminds me of the day I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be born. Just why? Is my life just a mistake? All I wish is for a good education without the pressure of fees. All I wish is for a scholarship and a good education‚Ä¶

"As a russian gen z gamer, I'm annoyed with millenials","Despite living in Uzbekistand for entire of life. But I spend much on DTF, a famous Russian gaming forum where people are discussing about pop culture news. And, sadly, it's full of annoying millenials who are too nostalgic for early 2000s PC gaming. You know, Gothic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Baldur's Gate and etc. These millenials really hate zoomers because, oh my god, we play much different games. Like Zelda, Genshin Impact and Minecraft. According to them, we are ""shit-eaters"" because we are not playing ""right games"". What's funny, many russian zoomers enjoy old Nintendo game slike Earthbound and Super Mario 64, even if they never played them in childhood. They know what is emulator. Russian millenials, in contrast, don't play these ""hipster shit"" and prefer to restrict themselves with a small amount of videogames they played in teenagehood. Oh my god... Even gen z russians are not going into too much to nostalgia like russian millenials. Gen z russian gamer are not obsessed with FNAF like Gen Y obsessed with Heroes of Might and Magic III. 

(Sigh) Sometimes, I really think that Russian millenials are truly the Lost Generation. Why? Because they survived 90s crisis at young age. I remember how I talked with Venezuelians and they are extremely rude in talking. Poverty, high criminality and other hopeless shit which where 90s in Russia really hurted mental health of many russians. Russia zoomers raised in more comfortable conditions and much well educated.

"Questions: Financial Support & Deciding Degree route","I want to start with, I am a 28 year old married mom who had attempted community college when I graduated high-school, got screwed over my financial aide by the end of the first semester due to lack of guidance with financial aide, and lack of communication on the school's end. Since then, I have been too afraid to pursue a degree. Now, I am looking to find a better paying job in a field I am interested in.

Financial Assistance:

Would I be eligible at all for any financial aide/assistance at my age if I decided to get a degree online? If so, what would be available to me?

Degree Decision:

I am torn between a couple of fields. 1) I initially tried getting a degree in Education to become a teacher and still long for it but do not think in this day in age it would be wise, nor am I confident in my abilities to teach. 2) I have expressed a huge interest in Computer Science for the sole idea of stable hours (9-5 kind of job), general lack of face to face communication, but mainly the salary and career possibilities. My concerns would be that it is over saturated and not a lot of open positions in IT. 3) Child/Family Therapy. I feel more connected to this due to growing up around mental health disorders within my siblings and going to therapy with them, some tragedy behind mental health within my family, and now facing mental disorders in my own son. My only concerns are the pay, and the hours along with do I need to do like a residency similar to nursing?

"Should I move? Advice needed","Im 20F and in college rn. A good friend of mine asked me a few days ago if I wanted to move into an apartment with her, and I don't know if I should do it. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons here. I'm worried I'm going to make the wrong decision. I'm barely an adult so I don't know what I'm doing really. 
 - - -
I'm about to go into my 3rd year of college, and I'm currently renting a 3 bed 2 bath house off-campus with 3 other girls. It's super close to campus, so it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to get to class from home depending on if traffic is bad. Its been so so convenient being this close. Even the church I go to is on campus. I got lucky and pay decently low rent monthly which includes all the utilities, electricity, etc. The only thing extra I pay is for wifi. And its a nice place. I have my own room which was a big upgrade from dorm life. I also moved in with the house basically being furnished. We're renting through my roommate's mom, and she loves interior design, so she basically furnished the place herself, and it looks really nice and feels homey. I also don't have to worry about any noisy upstairs neighbors.

The cons though are that we're very often having issues with the AC and water heater and we often have to call someone to fix it just for it to act up again not long later. Its not the safest area either, a little bit the opposite actually. My neighborhood is kind of like its own bubble and is relatively safe, but the immediate surrounding areas are definitely not the place you wanna find yourself in at night. If I need to go to the store I have to drive a decent ways down the road, too. Its also a good 30 minutes commute to my current job, which I don't really mind all that much. I'm also very often home alone. My roommates like to spend time a lot of with their family, while I usually stay at the house, and we all have very different schedules anyway, so I dont see them a lot, especially not during the summer. I've been alone at the house for months now. I'm conflicted whether or not I enjoy or hate that. Its gets unbearably lonely sometimes, but I also really need alone time, and I'm not very close with my roommates. I've known them since I started college but we're still in the awkward small talk phase almost two years later because we hardly ever interact. When we're all home, I usually end up staying (hiding) in my room or will just awkwardly be on the couch while the others talk. It feels awkward and like I'm out of place. I get self conscious being in my own home sometimes. 
 - - -
Now for the new place. Its a 2 bed 2 bath apartment. The rent is about $100 more monthly than what I currently pay, which includes all utilities except* electricity and wifi. The electricity bill apparently isn't bad though. I'd also be moving in with a friend who I know a lot better and feel more comfortable with. We get along pretty well. Its a pretty good location, too. The complex itself is in a pretty secluded spot but is also pretty close to a busier road with lots of stores and things nearby. Its a better part of town. 

The only things I'm worried about are the fact that it's much farther from my school's campus, about 20 minutes, but it's also a little closer to my job, and my commute to work would be more like 20 minutes instead of 30. Also the rent. I have no idea what to expect with fees and whatnot. Again, I got lucky that it was so simple with my current housing and been very reliable and consistent. I'm worried that the new place is going to have some hidden fees or weird rules or something ontop of the higher rent from what I pay now. This also might sound picky, but we probably wouldnt have much furniture for the new place. My friend was talking about buying a couch though. Pretty much any furniture I'd bring is for my room and probably wouldn't work anywhere else.
 - - -
I think most of my fears around this are the unknowns. My friend messaged me 2 days ago about it so I don't have a ton of information yet. She toured the place a few hours ago and said it was really nice. She also has a friend who moved into the same unit last week who said good things about the place and the pricing. 
I'm wondering though if I should stick with what I have because it's so stable: low rent, pretty much no variable fees or payments, the lady I rent through is super nice and relaxed, I get the house to myself a lot, etc. But I have no idea what I'm getting myself into with the new place. Also the timing has me anxious, because I'm going to need to make a decision soon, and I feel a little rushed. I don't want to make a decision hasilty or impulsively and regret it. But the lady we rent through (my roommate's mom) today texted all of us about renewing our lease for this year. I'm going to need to let her know ASAP if I actually decide to move.
I'm planning on scheduling a tour for the apartment soon and getting more information.

Any advice? Because I have no idea what I'm doing or how to adult. This is making me anxious. Would moving be worth it? ","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m92tm6/should_i_move_advice_needed/","1753458701.0","Adulting","naomi_macaroni"

"What is love ???","I, 18 M is never been in a relationship.

What is love , this word came to me when i 12 year old a few people in class started dating each other but i didn't give shit then but when i was 15 , I was interested in so called ""love"" so i wanted to date someone. So I'm type of guy who trys to understand something before doing it so, i asked my friends who was and is dating and all they gave me was bull shit like ""you will know when it comes"",""idk bro i can't explain it"" or ""you will get it at some point "" like wtf so of course i was confused so i gave up and focused on myself...

And i didn't have up so easily so i was trying to get the answer myself and asked my friends ""why did you love her, why her"" they came up with different answer some said ""personality"" some said ""character"" some said ""her body"" some said ""i like her whom she is"" so of course i didn't get it at all.. and of course i was attracted to some girls but this girl are not your typical avg girl (girl in malls or who is super hot) but i know that I'm out of their league and i won't see then in regular base..

I was not attracted to anyone in my school so i didn't have anyone to approach. At a point i thought ""maybe I'm gay"" but I'm not gay I was still attracted to super hot girl..

But something changed when i was 16 I liked a girl and it because i had a desire that before finishing school in wanted to have this Teen love . So when I was kid I fell in love with black widow from Avengers so because of her I had a thing for short hair girls...
So there was a argument between my class boy ""who is the prettiest girl in our school"" so i didn't have anyone to said A (let say that the girl is ""A"") and everyone was surprised and they started to tease me by her name we where we Cross into her (she was not in our ,we were at different sections) so there was a chance for me to talk to her and  i did (my voice broked alot) she followed me on insta that night and we talked for a few months and she knew that I like her but she didn't want that she just want someone to talk to soo... She rejected me before i could confess well after that things got so weird we got the same math teacher so we got class together and that was soo awkward and I was pathetic there because every mf knew that I got rejected and there she was as usual but me ,my eyes was soo filled with water that i could almost cried but no i didn't...

I know my love was a failing love because all the messages I send with love and my honest feelings all she gave back was nothing but a dry ass message and she used to left me on Read so many time but i always convensed myself that she is busy with something but no she was texting someone else...

Still today i think about her sometimes but i know that she didn't give a damn about me ...

Well maybe love isn't for me it like God is forbiddening me from fall in love . Well I'm supposed to good looking atleast that what others say . When i say i never dated anyone every single time people don't believe me idk what is wrong with me but well in still young so let's see maybe I may fall in love at some point and finally know ""what is love""........","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m98w5t/what_is_love/","1753472697.0","Adulting","JJ0yson"
"Men, why do you want to date women you don't want to date?","Over half the posts i get from here are men complaining about women. I don't get it. You see men complain about something women do and get frustrated with it, as they won't be able to date them. 

  
So, men, why are you so adamant to be upset over people that \*you don't want either way\*, literally their loss. Instead of looking for someone else you somehow want people change how they are for you, that just seems unproductive, what even interests you in these women in the first place when you seem to dislike them so much? Isn't that just a bullet dodged for you? 

  
Like the post i just got with the top comment complaining about mentally unstable women, just don't date them? Why are you interested enough in them in the first place to feel the need to get so upset if they do this thing that upsets you?! I don't hear the same from women usually.

"Trying to balance health, body image, and advice from doctors‚Ä¶ is this what adulting feels like?","
I‚Äôm 18, 161 cm tall, and weigh about 43 kg.
Recently, a doctor told me I should weigh 53 kg ‚Äúideally,‚Äù and it completely threw me off. I‚Äôve been focused on losing fat (belly, chest, face), not gaining weight ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm stuck in this weird adulting loop where I‚Äôm questioning everything I thought was healthy.

I don‚Äôt go to the gym. I eat vegetarian, stay in a hostel, avoid junk, and I walk daily. I‚Äôm not starving myself ‚Äî I just want to feel good and look a little more toned.
But some days I feel too skinny. Other days I feel bloated and heavy. The mirror plays mind games, and social media makes it worse.

So here I am, trying to understand:
‚Üí Is it normal to feel this confused about health at 18?
‚Üí Am I overthinking ‚Äúfat loss‚Äù at this weight?
‚Üí Or is this just the start of figuring out what being healthy actually means?

I‚Äôm not here for compliments

Anyone else been through something similar?

"Should I change my major to Med Lab Science?","I (23F) need some advice. I'm currently going into my junior year of college, and my plan thus far has been to get my degree in Biology and go to grad school or professional school in the medical field. 

However, I recently learned about a Med Lab Science degree program at my university, which in my state would land me a job making ~$60k with one extra year of undergrad straight out. Also, I work full time at the university, and I would be able to get this degree essentially debt-free.

I'm conflicted though, as I've always wanted to be hands-on helping others. It's my passion and I always felt I could achieve that through being an instructor or working in medicine. I doubt I could get that life fulfillment in Med Lab Science. 

Additionally, I always wanted to have ""the college experience,"" (working only part-time to focus on academics, kind of my dream for my youth) and my husband and I agreed I would get the chance when we earned our Bachelor's (I am also getting him through school debt-free). I never had the opportunity to since my parents refused to sign the FAFSA, and Ive worked full time since I was 18.

I know the financially smarter option would be to pursue the degree in Med Lab Science, but I still have this conflict. Any advice about making such a decision?","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m9ctxd/should_i_change_my_major_to_med_lab_science/","1753482308.0","college","2020akat"
"HELP AHHHH COLLEGE IS SCARY (Going into my 3rd year)","The long and short of it is that I'm pre-nursing right now, just finished my first year of pre requisites, my first year of college I took Biology and got EMT certified, only to learn my city doesn't hire EMT's under 21. I want to say I learned a lot that first year, and I did to an extent, I decided to change my major from Life Sciences to Pre-Nursing, but now I'm not sure if nursing is for me. 

I went and spoke to my counselor yesterday and am now considering getting back on Life Sciences for Pre-Med, or Animal Sciences for Pre-Vet, I have shadowed doctors before and can't say I felt any real pull towards the profession, but veterinary medicine does sound interesting, and I enjoy working with and learning about animals, I plan on shadowing my local vet soon to get a better idea about what the job is like. 

Ontop of all of this, I need to decide on a school to transfer to as I'm currently enrolled at a community college, and where I'm going to study abroad, hopefully starting Fall 2026. I'd love to get the opinion of other people on nursing vs pre-med. I really struggled my first year at college and had to drop pre-calculus because I couldn't handle the workload on-top of biology, but I really find the content interesting and feel like I'll be selling myself short by not taking STEM classes, but they also make me want to die. 

Very few of my nursing pre requisites count towards pre-med classes so I'm also stressed about having to start another 2 years of pre requisites, but I suppose that's silly in the grand scheme of things, and not something I should be worrying about if my goal is to find the right career for me. 

This is all a big thought bomb that's been packed in my brain so I apologize if I've not done a great job of explaining my predicament, and I'm happy to elaborate and clarify.

"I have no idea what to do","I'm an upcoming senior in high school (about a week away from going back to school). I have a good GPA (4.09 weighted), but almost no awards and my EC record is nonexistent. I have clubs, but I'm only active in one volunteering club and only participate occasionally. My test scores are average and my admissions essay draft is actual garbage because I feel like I have nothing to talk about. 

I'm going to my state's college, but I know I'm not going to score good scholarships (meaning that it will pay most or all of my tuition) because I'm not well rounded. I also won't receive that much financial help because my parents' combined salary isn't low enough for significant aid. We don't have money to pay out of pocket though.

I'm wondering whether I should just send my application early for priority or wait a bit later until I can add a little extra to my application (I'm taking the SAT again and joining new ECs). If I submit it now, it will be considerably empty in terms of activities, and I have no idea whether it will be considered even if I submit it early for that reason. My college has merit based scholarships based on GPA, but some of them will only cover about a fourth of regular tuition, and some that cover all are extremely competitive (they go to less than a hundred people). People say I should apply for them anyway, but I don't know when I should, and I'm likely not going to score them regardless. I'm not even sure whether or not test scores are taken into account, because my school is test optional and they don't mention it anywhere on the scholarship pages. I can't look at a recommended catalog for scholarships in my state yet because it isn't open for the 26-27 year, and I have no idea when it will open or if I'll find anything I can apply for easily.

What do you guys think the easiest route I should take if I want to cover majority of my tuition? I'm still clueless about financial stuff and I don't know what to do with less than a month. I also don't have anyone who was in my situation to help me, and I'm not in school yet. They might help us when we get back but I need help early so I can act early.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m9gb9g/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do/","1753491772.0","ApplyingToCollege","Cosm1cLaziness"
"Run-in with new neighbours - what do I do?","Okay, so, me (21F) and my husband (21M) are moving into a new place. It's a lovely house and we were so excited because we've only lived in 1 bed flats before. 

My husband is staying in the old place tonight because he has work and I am in the new place to get a furniture delivery in the morning. 

My friend (gender-neutral but AFAB, 21) has a big car and has driven up to help us move. 

The hill is steep and tight but there was a big space at the top. It was late (1am I think) because its a really long drive. 

My friend is at the top turning when a man comes out shouting, swearing and filming my friend. In a panic they reverse back a little and bump my car. The man then tries to open the door over and over again and then takes the keys out of the ignition and won't give them back. 

My friend is kind of frozen now because they don't have their keys, but if they leave the car this man could just drive off and he has already tried to get in the car.

Another woman comes out calling my friend a bitch. My friend rings me asking me to come out and I could tell something was wrong from their voice.

I come out and they start saying oh you know this person etc. And I say it's fine if they hit my car I'll deal with it, but they're saying they've also hit their car? They're both still shouting and swearing at us. The man is now saying I'm terrible as well because I nearly hit a car when I drove up and all this stuff, saying kids live here I could've hit a kid? I don't even think I did nearly hit a car when I came up?
I just sort of stand there trying really hard not to cry. Then eventually muster - what would you like us to do now? I did also manage to say that we have just moved, but I didn't manage to say it was literally this morning we got the keys. 

They sort of say something about damages then ask me to move my car back, so that my friend could get out, so I do. 

The man then insists on moving my friends car. 

They ask me to move my car again but I don't understand where they want me to go. I move it back a bit and he says he can move it. 

I'm shaking and crying at this point so I just let him (I know I shouldn't have but there's no way I could've moved it).

As I already knew, there was no damage to their car (because my friend hadn't even touched it! I had a look before they moved!) And not even any damage to my car which they had very gently bumped. 

Another woman comes out and both the women are saying it's fine now but the man is still grumpy about something. 

My friend moved their car to the bottom of the hill and I waited in the house having a mild panic attack.

So, I guess, what do we even do?! Do we grovel to the neighbours? Was him taking my friends keys even legal? I don't even know I'm just really overwhelmed we have to live opposite them now and I never want to drive up that hill again.

Now to clarify what i mean by dead: I go outside and feel as though that there's very little to do, nobody wants to talk and nothing to see, it's like i wasn't made for it.

I felt this way as a kid, and as an adult its even worse, since you're not guaranteed social interaction at your job like you were at school.

  
I've been a shut-in my whole life, i only really go out with friends with family, and the reason for that is because i just don't see the point of going outside. Now i do enjoy doing a great many things alone, it just so happens all of them are on my pc.

I have no memories of any walk i ever took through any park, i've never spoken to a stranger in a caf√© after a lifetime attending them. The few times i've had actual conversations with complete randos outside are just neutral or boring. Closest to positive was some crazy old men telling me absolute nonsense, which was at least funny.

I can and have approached people but it gets tiring and its just plain boring when you realize that few people have much to say to a guy they've just met.

It's not even that i feel society is negative, it's overwhelmingly neutral and most daily interactions i have are somewhat quite pleasant. Lots of ""good day"", smiling, people saying ""excuse me"" whenever they wanna shuffle past me. I actually have maybe a couple of negative memories in about 4-5 years of riding a subway multiple times a day almost every day. 

I often feel as though there's no alternative to lonely people the internet, when i had no friends and nobody to talk to the easiest way to guarantee i'd talk to no one was by going outside and not stay online.

I often felt a great disconnect whenever i try to talk people about this. Replies i get usually boil down to: assuming i have anxiety disorder (which i don't have), telling me to go to church (and im not religious), talking about how shit society is (which i don't believe it is) or basically dismissing everything i said and saying im doing a usual shpeal about feelings of complete apathy (which is not what this is about).

I have things i like, friends i like to be with, activities i enjoy doing. But just going outside on my own honestly always felt less social than being inside.

Everytime i go outside i feel like there's nothing out there for me. In truth, i always felt there wasn't.

"How do I make friends?","My boyfriend and I just made a big move to a new city since we both graduated college. We‚Äôre in our early 20s but are struggling to make friends. We can‚Äôt afford much right now but I want to find a way for us to get out there but together and individually. The only people we know are through work. It‚Äôs hard to break through that professional barrier + very few of our co-workers are our age. Does anyone have advice on how to make friends in this weird stage of life? Any advice appreciated.

"Trying to level up my life, but my parents keep pulling me back","I'm 26 and currently working part-time in retail, but my store refuses to give me more hours. So, I‚Äôve been job hunting and just landed an interview for a position 45 minutes away from where I live. I'm hoping it could turn into something full-time or even a coordinator role, since I‚Äôve built up almost a year of retail sales experience.

Here‚Äôs the complicated part, my mom just got a job near that area too, and suddenly she‚Äôs really worried about me driving back home at night. The store closes at 8 PM, and I‚Äôd be driving home at a reasonable hour, but she‚Äôs treating it like it‚Äôs unsafe or irresponsible. My parents also said they can‚Äôt afford a third car, but they won‚Äôt share anything about their finances with me, which makes it hard to understand the full picture.

I‚Äôm doing my best to take real steps toward independence, but it feels like every time I try, I get pulled back by family dynamics that don‚Äôt respect that I‚Äôm an adult. I get that I still live in their house, and yes, they pay the bills, but I‚Äôm trying to move forward and make progress. It‚Äôs discouraging when the people closest to you don‚Äôt seem to support that.

Just needed to vent. If anyone‚Äôs been in a similar situation, trying to grow while still under your parents' roof. Please advise when possible because it‚Äôs only getting worse and I might yell at them if I struggle to level up while them worrying.
