"i‚Äôm not my mothers baby anymore","I 22f live at home with my mother 56f, i have health issues (physical and mental) and have not had a proper job in my life. i have worked at pubs since i was 18 but due to my illnesses i always have to cut my time short and leave. i do still pay my way with the benefits, though it‚Äôs not a lot the agreement we came up with was 15% of whatever i make that month 

she‚Äôs constantly in my business, and i love her but she‚Äôs very passive aggressive about it all. for context of how bad it is, i used to be big when i was about 14-18 and she would go through the trash to see what i had eaten that day. ( point to mention that when my brother lived with us he would eat everything and blame it on me because of my weight and she would believe him every time, to the point where she would hide food from me. she was a boy mom and not in a good way but that‚Äôs whole other story) i developed a restrictive ed and am thankfully in recovery but now she‚Äôs started doing the same thing. i have gained weight, but its healthy weight and im no where near as big as i was before

when i worked at the pub, my ed was destroying my life. i also gained a problem with alcohol and would have frequent autistic meltdowns. i had to leave, but she didn‚Äôt like that. i explained it to her and she told me that ‚Äúit was my future i was ruining‚Äù and that i should‚Äôve found another job first. i‚Äôm not against that idea and i do agree that it would‚Äôve been more ideal, but i was struggling so badly that it felt like i had no choice for my sanity just to leave

i‚Äôm currently doing two courses on SEND education and autism on its own. because of my issues (i‚Äôm autistic, have anxiety, in recov for anorexia and have adenomyosis. i really struggled with school and education) she has always been reluctant but supportive whenever i‚Äôve made a decision to go back to college as i think she wants me to do well for myself but doesn‚Äôt believe that i am able to do it. i think that she thinks im lazy. on top of college, i volunteer at a primary school near by where both of my nephews attend. i volunteered at the primary school before taking on my college courses, but ive found that i need to prioritise college in this situation. i feel guilty as i love the kids in the school and this week will be the last week before the summer holidays but these college courses are like a crash course. they‚Äôre both 1 session a week for 11 weeks at a time which means that the whole course is relying on you having time at home to get the work you need done because of how short they are. 

in my head it is not beneficial for me to just volunteer at a school in hopes that they would offer me a job, though it‚Äôs great to have experience, i need to get my qualifications more than anything right now. by the time the kids go back in september, i will only be doing one course and have more time for the school. my mum thinks this is a bad idea, but i don‚Äôt know how to explain to her that im 22. i‚Äôm not her baby anymore, im a fully grown adult who can make my own adult choices regarding my future. i‚Äôm trying to do this to gain independence and she‚Äôs constantly making passive aggressive comments like ‚Äúdo whatever you want it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll listen to me anyway‚Äù. 

i feel suffocated and guilty all of the time and i don‚Äôt know what to do.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m4zcrm/im_not_my_mothers_baby_anymore/","1753043705.0","Adulting","cinamorollulu"

"Mother","I wonder how my mother thinks of me. Probably differently than my sister. My mother never really talked to me with kind eyes and maybe because of me. I don't know what changed us. There is a gap between us that we cannot fill. I love her and maybe she loves me back too. Can I say controlling and over protection are a part of love? 

Will she ever feel better if I leave or will she be hurt? There are questions that I want to ask but too afraid. My mother never tried to understand me and I don't blame her, I don't understand myself at times. But what about the feelings I carry. 

She cares about everyone and everything as I observed her. Her tone changes when she talks to me. She says she never had a bias but she lies everytime. I feel uncomfortable, unhappy, scared, my fight or flight mode gets activated somehow and it's around her, or when she comes toward me.

"Should I commute or dorm in college?","Not this comming year, but the year after I will be in college, I have chosen to go to a local state school about 20 to 25 minutes from my house. I need to decide if I should dorm or commute.

Reasons to commute:

1. it would be cheaper. I will most likely get a full ride to the college, but that only covers tuition. The dorm would be about between $3,370 and $5,890 per semester depending on the housing chosen. I would have to pay anything that scholarships and grants out of pocket and I dont want student debt. 

2. I am already comfortable at home and I would have pets and a safe spot. Also because of my autism, if I get overstimulated while dorming i dont know if I'll have a safe spot or not. I also won't have to worry about getting along with a roommate and it might be easier to do my therapy sessions. I also think that by dorming I'll be more exposed to things that overstimulated and upset me.

3. I don't know if I'll be able to make friends. I hear that dorming is great if you have friends, but I haven't made any ""friend"" since middle school and that turned out horribly. I have no problem talking to people, I just have a lot of trouble trusting them enough to ask to hang out and stuff that friends do. I dont think I'll like dorming without friends.

Reasons to dorm:

1. I would learn how to function in society. I would have to remember when to do things which would help me for the future, expesually that after college I plan on moving to another country that does not speak English (Japan), so yeah independence might be a kinda useful skill for me to improve at.

2. Some people are able to make friends while dorming. My older sibling is in college and dorms. They have made lots of friends, and they are more quiet than me. They also found a significant other to. I see my sibling hanging out with their friends from college and I want a friend to.

3. I would get more freedom. My sibling, who is 19 still has to ask mom to do stuff when they are at home, but when they are at college they can do whatever they want and mom can't do anything. So if I commute, I will likely have to get permission to do anything or go anywhere even though I would be an adult. I would also have to keep following my mom's rules and I would have to still do things I dont like when im told, like shaving my legs if I commute. I wouldn't have to worry about doing or not doing what Mom says as much if I dorm though. But I might make bad decisions and ruin everything too so... I dont know if this is a good or bad thing.

4. The major that I will do (elementary education) has whole dorms with living learning centers in the college. I dont know exactly how it works, but I think you can choose to live with other education majors and have classes or do activities on education stuff right in the dorm or something. I do think that commuting education majors still have access to this though.

5. It would be more convenient. If I were to commute, my mom would have to drive me because their is only 1 car. And I really dont want to get my own car to drive myself because 1. I can't afford it and 2. I hopefully will be on the other side of the world after college so it's not worth it. My mom is more than willing to provide transportation, but I would have to work around her schedule since their is only 1 car.

I have time to think about it, since I still have to do senior year, but I need to start thinking about dorming or commuting since I know what college I'm going to, my major, and what I want to do after college (plus a plan b if that doesn't work out) I just have the dorming/commuting thing left. I think my main concern is the cost because I know that I'll have to pay back any student loans I get on my own and paying off student debt is hard and it is not a good idea to go to Japan as an ALT (assistant language teacher) with American student debt because student debt is a lot more in America than it is in Japan (Japan just has a lower cost of living overall which also means lower pay) and the yen is weak to the usd.

Do you think I'll be better off commuting or dorming? Both are doable for me i think. Feel free to ask any questions below.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m53eeh/should_i_commute_or_dorm_in_college/","1753054121.0","college","Desperate_Sector7326"
"Why do I feel so frustrated about sex?","I'm a 32-year-old man, and I recently moved to a small town in the U.S. I‚Äôd really love to connect with and date women here. But this brings up a deep frustration and anger that I‚Äôve carried for years when it comes to relationships with women‚Äîespecially intimate ones.

I take care of my appearance, and both friends and several women have told me I'm attractive. And yet, I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend or been in a ‚Äúrelationship.‚Äù I‚Äôve only had two sexual encounters, but they were neither enjoyable nor satisfying because of the intense anxiety that has consumed my mind since adolescence.

Because of this, over the past 3 or 4 years, I‚Äôve reached a point where I spend most of my days feeling sad, worried, frustrated, and full of self-hatred for not having figured this out at my age. What keeps my mind trapped is FEAR. That fear of intimacy and seduction just won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm still incredibly shy and anxious when talking to women (and people in general), which makes it almost impossible for me to connect with someone on a deeper level. Honestly, after thinking about this for so long, I‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs just social and sexual anxiety, or if it‚Äôs a deeper emotional block. (I should mention that I was heavily bullied as a kid, and I suspect that‚Äôs played a role in my difficulty approaching women.)

It feels like I never developed ‚Äúemotional maturity‚Äù in this area. Since most people go through their first relationships and sexual experiences during their teenage years, and that didn‚Äôt happen for me, I feel stuck. Social media makes everything worse because we're constantly bombarded with hypersexualized content, and I can‚Äôt escape that overwhelming pressure. It leaves me feeling frustrated and powerless as a man‚Äîas if I‚Äôm failing at something that‚Äôs supposed to come naturally. And the more time goes by, the harder it gets. The fear only grows stronger, and obviously, I can‚Äôt just tell a woman that I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend or dating experience, because by this age, most women already have a lot of experience just by virtue of being women.

I want to be clear that I‚Äôve seen many psychologists and psychiatrists since I was 17. I‚Äôve tried every antidepressant and medication I‚Äôve been prescribed, but NOTHING has worked. The worst part is that this isn‚Äôt something I can talk about openly with just anyone. Therapists don‚Äôt seem to know how to properly address sexual anxiety‚Äîthey just tell me: ‚ÄúGo out and talk to women,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not that simple. Approaching someone and forming a connection that leads to intimacy takes much more than just talking.

I‚Äôm considering seeing a sex therapist or trying some kind of sexual therapy, but honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to hear the typical advice like ‚Äújust pay a prostitute,‚Äù because that‚Äôs not what I truly want. I‚Äôve had Tinder for years, and even though I get quite a few matches, nothing ever happens. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to meet anyone in person for all the reasons I‚Äôve mentioned. I regularly hang out with friends, and they‚Äôve tried giving me advice and even introducing me to women, but I always end up avoiding the situation. Just thinking about going on a date with no experience makes me feel absolutely terrible.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you!","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m53gn1/why_do_i_feel_so_frustrated_about_sex/","1753054285.0","Adulting","Titus4266"

"Am I doing enough to get my degree.?","I‚Äôm in my early 20s, I‚Äôm doing part time community college due to early life during high school of being an idiot, but also financially not able to afford living in campus. 

I always grew up being last, I had a IEP in my childhood and abused it later on to be lazy and not learn, during my early high school years I always got people to laugh and make friends, I was a comedian to the class I was a known person in some ways, I guess it was my fitting in dream, during that time I was academically doing horribly, D in algebra and nearly a F in gym, only good grade I got was in history, later on in high school I locked in, I actually improved my GPA to a 3.4 but also decided to major in education after being inspired by a teacher, history was the only good thing I was good in, I actually had fun in. 

I decided to do community college, my SAT was shit, my income was lacking and i didn‚Äôt wanna be a burden on anyone but myself. My first semester was a fucking laughing stock. I took one class, and nearly failed, i had zero clue how to write a research paper to anything else, however it didn‚Äôt stop me, I grew from that frustration and started trying to understand it, I only got D‚Äôs in two other classes math and science however ever since then I gotten As or Bs, I could write 8 paper research papers like it was nothing in philosophy to political science. 

However I been working nonstop just to afford college, I could only take two classes to successfully pass with good grades but also not be too expensive. I‚Äôm nearly my transfer date and god damn NJ isn‚Äôt helping at all with these tuition costs, I‚Äôm stuck researching how much each credit costs, what classes transfer and not, it‚Äôs been a god damn roller coaster.

Meanwhile I see fellow peers graduating and getting a start in their adult life, I started realizing that I‚Äôm being left behind honestly, it frustrates me, not only that but I‚Äôm lacking any college friends. I talked to no one really I‚Äôm constantly working during the afternoons till night and I take classes early morning.

I won‚Äôt have massive debt like everyone else but how the fuck do I afford transferring over, how can I finish faster.

"What do Australians think about thisÔºü","I‚Äòm a junior student planning to go to Australia.(99% going to Australia in the future) Frankly, I'm worried.(very) Australian universities have a terrible (you heard me right, terrible) reputation in China because a lot of  Chinese students simply buy their way through everything. It's downright ridiculous that some students managed to graduate without knowing how to speak English.

Now i 'm not saying that Australian universities are terrible, I just don't find the idea of using international students as cash cows comfortable. I know that the schools are worth attending, but i'm just worried. I've even heard rumors that some classes are taught in Chinese !!!!

I was originally planning to go to the u.s but my dad changed my mind. He said it would be nice if our family could live in the same country in the future, and since my brother studied in Sydney, he figured that i would go to Australia for college as well. (He loves Australia, saying that Australians have the highest resource/person rate, he also praises the welfare that Australians get, and also the scenery, and this, and that.........so on)

It's absolutely crazy that near half the students in the university of Sydney are international students.

"ending with two C's for my first college classes","i am so disappointed in myself and i hate myself. i was in community college for 4 years and had up and downs with my gpa due to working and struggling with health issues. one of the most reassuring things about transferring is that the gpa calculation is seperate at institutions, so my gpa 'starts over' at my university of transfer. (although for grad admissions they are combined) 

this summer i took two classes (online) for my majors and i will be ending with a 75 in both of them and i am just so disappointed. i was barely hanging on but last week my cat suddenly and tragically passed, and i missed big assignments for both classes. i just recalcuated both grades and thought that for one class i'll take it pass/no pass but the other class i would end with an A. i thought that other class had more assignments and i can't take it pass/no pass because it's a major requirement and not a major elective. 

i'm just so angry with myself. theres nothing i can do to ask because i already haven't been a good student in this class. i could take it pass/no pass and retake the major requirement class but i had to spend 3000 dollars out of pocket for the summer session so it would just be a huge waste of money. i could withdraw but again, huge awaste of money with no refund.

"Working at a casino","Hello, I‚Äôm wanting to know what your opinion is on this. 

My mom started a new job exactly a month ago, as a cage cashier at a casino. She was trained for 1 week. Her second week she made an honest mistake which was her fault (a cash advance for $1000 but typed in $100 and was short $900). She has to pay this back by the casino taking out $250 from every paycheck. 

Last week she turned her back and noticed another worker swapping money out of her till. My mom asked the girl what she was doing, and not to do that since she‚Äôs responsible for the 200k that‚Äôs in there. This started an argument with the girl, essentially the girl calling my mom racist. (Which she‚Äôs never been. If she took the time to get to know my mom she would know that me, and all her kids are mixed and biracial). 

Well fast forward to last night, she worked with a new manager. I guess the manager counts their till again after the shift. The manager typed in something wrong. This manager texted my mom ‚Äúyou cannot come back to work until you pay $300‚Äù. My mom lives paycheck to paycheck. Of course she‚Äôs already stressed. She was literally crying over this. Another manager calls my mom the morning after and says ‚Äúthis was a managers mistake. You don‚Äôt owe $300 but you will be pointed, and can come into work‚Äù my mom responded ‚Äúpointed for what? If you‚Äôre pointing me I might as well stay home‚Äù. In which she did lol 

I‚Äôm already helping her find a new job. This is ridiculous and I can‚Äôt even imagine having to pay back for mistakes. I work at a bank and we have never had to pay anything to be able to work. This isn‚Äôt the club!! Lmao.

"is UNC worth applying to as an out-of-state student?","hi, i‚Äôm a rising senior trying to finalize my college list! i was looking at unc as a high reach school, and had the opportunity to tour it last year; i loved the campus, but i recently learned that its out of state admissions pool is far more competitive than i realized (yes, i put off researching schools quite a bit).

i obviously assumed it‚Äôd be considerably lower than the acceptance rate on google, but i didn‚Äôt realize it had a quota system like my state school (UT austin) does, so over 80% of its students are in-state and its oos acceptance rate is like 7%. i was comparing it to the threshold i had in my mind of UC's, which differ by like 1-2 percent for in vs out of state.

this makes it pretty much the most competitive school i have on my list by far, and i‚Äôm wondering if it would even be worth applying as a pre-law (econ or policy + socsci) major in such a competitive and saturated applicant pool. i have a decent profile but nothing t20 level (3.99 uw, about 17 ap‚Äôs, 1570 sat, not great awards, okay ec‚Äôs including research and npo stuff). finances aren‚Äôt really a concern in this situation either. 

i‚Äôm also worried i won‚Äôt even have enough reaches if i take unc off, i only have like 9 and i see everyone on this website shotgunning all the t20‚Äôs. i‚Äôd appreciate any help or insights from out of state kids at state schools.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m59gn3/is_unc_worth_applying_to_as_an_outofstate_student/","1753072059.0","ApplyingToCollege","underthetrees13"
"Is it silly to want to move out of state because I hate my job?","I (25F) started a new job back in February and for all intents and purposes I love what I do and I love most of my coworkers. Best part is getting to meet new people! It's a small business so there's only 10 of us, and I'm the only other person who's on the sales team besides my boss and he's been putting a lot of pressure on me to be closing sales, working on our website, posting on social media and it's exhausting (not to mention a lot of roles to take on)! 

Now, the title is slight hyperbole, I don't entirely hate it, just more so anxious from all the goals and getting burnt out. And my current job is in a field that I've studied (graphic design and print), so the idea of trying to find another job in the same field that pays just as well or better is not exactly ideal. 

However, it keeps crossing my mind. Not only do I want a fresh start, but I just can't see myself staying in this place forever, so why not go all out and just leave my state entirely. I'm from the Bay Area in CA, and I've been eyeing Chicago for quite some time. My career is not the only reason I want to move out, but it is a big part of it for sure. And I'm the kind of person to be pretty rational about things and think things through meticulously (I'm a big ""make a list of everything, pros and cons""). I'm not spontaneous when it comes to big decisions like this at all. I just want a second opinion on if my strong emotions on this are just heightened because of the stress or if it's a totally normal feeling to want to get out üò≠.

I kinda have an idea on the answer already but it would be nice to hear from other people if they've experienced this feeling before too.

Kahit ganyan kita ng mama ko hindi ako nang hingi or nag ask ng tulong na bumili naman siya minsan ng bigas or ulam kasi kulang pa yang kita niya sa mga utang niya. 

A little bit of background, last year lang. na scam si mama kasi mag gold daw sa lupain namin. Confirmed by the detector. Unfortunately, gumasta na siya ng more than 300K tapos walang nahukay. Yung 300K worth yun ng mga alahas niya lahat na sinangla niya. Ngayon, hindi ko siya ma help kasi marami rin akong utang. 

Now, may lupain kami na 1 hectare. At wala namang naiipasok na pera sa pamilya. Ilang beses ko na siya kinausap na mag benta nalang kami ng lupa para matapos na mga utang niya and pati na rin mga utang ko. Pero ayaw niya baka kasi daw totoo yung treasure tapos maling lokasyon lang yung nahukay namin. Baka daw mabinta namin tapos mahukay nung naka bili.

"I 20F think my partner 20M is going through an existential crisis","Hi. I‚Äôm in a relationship with someone who has avoidant tendencies. We‚Äôve been together for a year and a half, and we‚Äôve just entered our 20s. In the past, whenever he got overwhelmed, he would shut down or pull away without communicating, which almost led to breakups. But recently, we had a serious talk, and he admitted that leaving when things get hard isn‚Äôt a healthy way to cope, and he said he wants to grow from that.

Lately, though,I‚Äôve been sensing that he‚Äôs becoming distant again. Both of us have been extremely busy (I‚Äôm a med student), so we rarely get to talk or see each other. I also admitted that I haven‚Äôt been giving our relationship much attention lately because of my hectic schedule.

Last week, we finally got to see each other, even if just for a short time. We weren‚Äôt as affectionate as we used to be, but out of nowhere, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have motivation for anything lately.‚Äù When I asked why, he said he didn‚Äôt know. I told him I appreciated that he opened up, since that‚Äôs something he rarely does.

"Core GPA and Cumulative GPA","Hi, I am a rising senior in high school and have some questions about core and cumulative GPA.  
I currently have a mid-range cumulative GPA with a strong upward trend, so I thought I would be fine. However, when I recalculated it using ChatGPT, I found out that my core GPA was lower than 3.5, which surprised me.  
I think this is mainly because I got a D and a C in history classes (I‚Äôm not good at history), and most of my electives and advanced courses were non-core classes. Since my school doesn't offer AP or IB courses, I chose to focus on dual enrollment classes and electives related to my interests, such as business, microeconomics, and management.  
In summary, my cumulative GPA better reflects me as a whole person, since I took many non-core classes to dive deeper into my interests, whereas my core GPA is lower.

I saw a post that colleges are mainly focusing on core GPA (which means I'm cooked). What should I do now?

"I got bullied because my toilet stall door was kicked down","I was bullied while I was 13 and 14 during secondary school. (I live in England, so that‚Äôs high school for Americans)

 It all started at the beginning of the school year when I was minding my own business, taking a piss in a school toilet stall when all of a sudden I hear 3 girls storm in, screaming and creating a ruckus. Then my toilet stall door slams open, (while I am still sitting down on the freaking toilet) and undertandably, I panic. Luckily, my reflexes kick in and I manage to hold my hand out and close it. My heart was racing so fast. While that was happening, the girl who kicked down my door also kicked all the other stalls open, they continued laughing and then abruptly left. 

Now, I am still in the toilet stall, absolutely shook after all that. Of course, I didn‚Äôt want them to get away with what they just did so I quickly got out, washed up and went to look for a teacher. I found one, and luckily the girls were still there, but I didn‚Äôt know them, or which one kicked down the door. All I remember hearing was this one girl‚Äôs name constantly being shouted out, so I told him her name, what happened that then left. Somehow, that teacher knew those girls, especially the one I‚Äôd mentioned and immeadiately gave her a detention. (That detention was only about 10 minutes with the teacher, and they just talked about what she did wrong and why she shouldn‚Äôt do it again during that time) Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd just got myself into. 

As I mentioned, it was at the start of the year and my beautiful luck got me in classes without a single one of my friends with me.(I still hung out with throughout the school year, we just didnt share any classes together.) And on the first day of PE class, guess who was there? The girl I had snitched on, and she was pissed. (Bear in mind, before this point I had no idea who she was, and we‚Äôd never met before) Within this short amount of time, she‚Äôd told about 20 girls about me snitching on her, and now I had about 20 new people ready to start bullying me. It was hell. 

Everywhere I went I was met with this hostile atmosphere, and I coudn‚Äôt escape it, since all of my new classes had at least seven of these girls in them. I was regularly made fun of, and had to endure it in all of my classes except 3. I was only ever verbally abused, but it came really close to turning physical many times. 

During this time, my mental health worsened a lot, and I quickly became su1cidal. I cried every night and felt so unwanted. Worst thing? I didn‚Äôt even realise I was getting bullied. I only made that realisation one day after the only two friends I made said they‚Äôd told the teacher about me getting bullied, and that she needed to hear it from me first. I never ended telling her, as I didn‚Äôt want to believe that was what was going on.

As the school year went on, they only started being more violent until the summer holidays/ summer break rolled around. I was finally set free, but at what cost? My mental state was so degraded from all the bullying, I hated myself and honestly just wanted to die. I cried every night during that time, and even when I was finally away from it all, I couldn‚Äôt let go. I was quite depressed, and just shut myself off from everyone. It was a really hard time. Even now, looking back on it I regret cutting off my family members, but I‚Äôm always conflicted as I understand I just needed time. 

It all came to a sort of end the next year, but not without a ‚Äúbang‚Äù. I was finally back in classes with my friends, but not with my good friends who helped me get through the tough times the previous year anymore.

 I was sitting in the new class for a useless subject called PSHE (Personal,Social,Health,Education or basically a free period minus the freedom) when the teacher started assigning seats, and I was sat next to a girl. 5 minutes after the seat assignment, she tells the teacher ‚Äú Can I move, I can‚Äôt sit next to her because she had a problem with my mate in y9‚Äù. My heart drops. I‚Äôve never seen this girl in my entire life, she doesnt even know as much as my name, and she says doesn‚Äôt like me. This was like the breaking point for me, and I don‚Äôt know why I did it, but my mental state was so degraded I asked her ‚ÄúWhy do you hate me?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt say anything. Then I said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to hate me, you can just dislike me or something‚Äù She replied ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt control what people think of others, you don‚Äôt have the right‚Äù I just sat there in silence and cried. 

Later on, my friends would start to become close to this girl, I didn‚Äôt want them to even interact with her,as she supported the girls who bullied me, but I held back. I realised that if I said something, I would be helping estrange someone, and I didn‚Äôt want someone else to experience what I had in even the slightest way. Because of that, I finally ended up reporting everything that happened the previous year to the school. When I was done breaking down and explaining, I asked the woman I was talking to what would happen. Take a guess at what she said. ‚ÄúWell, maybe we‚Äôll just show them a presentation on why they shouldn‚Äôt bully people‚Äù And that never happened. 

If you‚Äôd have asked me the person I hated the most during that time, I would‚Äôve replied ‚Äúmyself‚Äù. I hated the fact I was always waiting for someone to come and ‚Äúsave me‚Äù while I was getting bullied, and I just sat there waiting like a little princess. I still wish I would‚Äôve stuck up for myself, but that‚Äôs easier said than done.

"19M, Married, Obese, Weak-Minded, Broke, Dreaming of Travel with Family ‚Äî Delhi or Hometown?","

I'm a 19-year-old married guy, and my life right now is in a very dark, confusing place. But I have dreams ‚Äî and I‚Äôm trying to get out of this hole, for myself and my family.

Here‚Äôs my raw truth:

I'm obese, have a girly voice, and likely suffer from low testosterone (no energy, low confidence, small penis, weak focus).

I'm physically strong, but mentally very weak.

I shake in small arguments, can‚Äôt talk loudly, and feel dizzy or lost all the time.

I have zero willpower and haven‚Äôt earned anything till now.

I‚Äôm fully dependent on my family, and we‚Äôre under a ‚Çπ4 lakh (~$5k) debt.

The only income is ‚Çπ30,000/month (~$350).

I‚Äôm currently doing BCA, but don‚Äôt feel confident in it.

I work at my father's shop in Delhi from 10 AM‚Äì3 PM and 6 PM‚Äì12:30 AM, and rest 3‚Äì6 PM. That‚Äôs my entire day.


Despite all this, I have two dreams:


---

1. To clear my family‚Äôs debt and earn ‚Çπ1 lakh/month (~$1200)
2. To take my family on a trip to places like Manali, Ladakh, and Mizoram ‚Äî someday soon


---

But now I‚Äôm stuck at a major decision point:

Should I stay in Delhi, where there are more learning/job opportunities (freelance, digital skills, agency jobs etc.) but I‚Äôm always exhausted from shop work and living under pressure?

Or should I move back to my hometown (Sheohar, Bihar), where I could open a small computer training centre, live cheaper, and possibly have more time ‚Äî but I won‚Äôt get the same exposure, speed, or digital clients that Delhi can offer?


---

My questions:

What would you choose in my position: Delhi hustle or hometown independence?

How do I fix my mind, body, and energy first?

What‚Äôs a real, practical skill I can learn in 2‚Äì3 hours/day and earn ‚Çπ1 lakh/month in 4‚Äì5 months?

Has anyone here climbed out of a place like this? What changed your life?



---

I don‚Äôt want pity or fake motivation. I want direction, structure, and real guidance.
If you‚Äôve been here, or helped someone through this, your comment could change a life.

"Anyone else kinda tired of the ""where you go to college doesn't matter"" pep talks","I agree mostly with the sentiment but: 

1) Sometimes these posts border on na√Øve - realistically it doesn't matter to a huge extent, but some posts are bordering on delusional acting like where you go to college won't make any difference in your life. Sure, you can succeed from any college, but don't act like certain colleges don't open up certain opportunities for you. This is field-dependent, but there are plenty of fields where it does very much matter where you go to college. 

2) As relevant as A2C is of a subreddit for these types of posts considering all the prestige-whores, the basis of this subreddit is to help students find help and camaraderie in the college admissions process to try and find the best college options for themselves - whether that's academically, fit-wise, or financially. If treating college admissions like it matters bothers you, honestly find another subreddit - a2c is not really good for anyone's mental health, so I don't know what people are really doing here if they are going to act like their above everyone because they came to the realization that college doesn't matter. Like this is a subreddit about college apps, ofc people are stressed out and care to some extent. I agree it's often unhealthy, but lowk the same pep-talk over and over again is not helping the issue. 

3) Stop with the anecdotal success stories of yourself, your cousin, or your uncle who went to community college and landed a 6 figure salary at facebook. I don't get the point of these anecdotes - I 100% agree with the sentiment that you can definitely succeed without a prestigious degree - but the success story is really an n=1 thing that won't make prestige-obsessed highschoolers change their minds. doesn't really support your argument well either. 

Anyways yeah i need to stop yapping and ranting. just to be clear im not a prestige-whore who thinks HSers should all be obsessing and stressing over which college they get into, all i'm saying is that these posts are often very ineffective, at least in my very PERSONAL opinion.

"Is it worth spending more if you get more freedom and peace?","For privacy reasons, I will not state the exact cost.

  
I am between two colleges, Francis Marion University and Coastal Carolina University. The thing is, I am a transfer student, so if I go to either one, I only have to spend 2 years and get out. I am planning to major in SCM and minor in data or marketing. 

  
I would say my experience at the CC was not the best, and I was very depressed due to how lonely I was. The college did not offer any clubs in regard to my interests. The reason I am posting this is due to a dilemma. I really would like to go to Coastal Carolina University, because it is a much bigger school with more opportunities around the city, and trying to gain some sort of independence from my strict household. But it also means that my father has to pay more than like 70k for like two years (all expenses). Whereas, if I were to stay home, I could finish my two years under 50k, since I would be living at home, meaning only covering my tuition. Also, before anyone says, ""Oh, get more scholarships,"" legally, I cannot qualify for it. 

I know at Coastal I can try to cover my expenses, but having more than 4 classes and managing a part-time job can be tough, and honestly, my dad still has to pay a bigger bill at the end of the day anyway. 

  
I talked to him today, and he said he is willing to help if I focus well on my education and try to progress somehow. I still am very undecided, even though he said yes, because it is a fuck ton of money for 2 years for a mid public school, and considering the economy, I might even have trouble looking for a job with a business degree. 

  
I really would like someone's insight on this. I don't have much time to decide. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m5p59n/is_it_worth_spending_more_if_you_get_more_freedom/","1753118769.0","ApplyingToCollege","Usual_Trifle1517"

"[URGERNT] I got a job offer but I go to college a month from today","(I HAVE TO REPLY IN 24HRS) Hi, I‚Äôm an incoming freshman. I‚Äôve been looking for a job since before the end of my senior year. My family and I were in the process of moving two weeks before I graduated. About a week before graduation, I received the address of our new house and started applying for jobs. I got a job interview around three weeks into summer break, but they ended up hiring someone two days before my interview, so I continued applying. Most of the places I applied to had job listings while they were no longer hiring or weren‚Äôt hiring at all. Then I applied to Target about three weeks ago‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know there was one pretty close to my house. I got a job offer today, but my start date is August 6th, and I start college on August 21st. I won‚Äôt be able to work on the 15th because it‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs birthday dinner. The day before she goes off to college, I want my last day to be the 20th, so I would only be working a few days if I accept, but I do need the money. My mom suggested I come home every weekend to work I live about 30 to 40 minutes from my college, depending on traffic, so I‚Äôm not sure if that will work I‚Äôve been burnt out before, and it took me a year to recover I used to get sick from stress when I had a job in 11th grade, and I got demotivated and depressed, even thinking about taking a gap year. I ended up recovering after a year and decided to go to college. No offense to my mom, but she‚Äôs the type to accept or suggest something and then complain about it, and I don‚Äôt want or need that. My mom doesn't like traveling more than 30 minutes if it's not for vacation or for college.  So please, I need advice. 

So what I‚Äôm asking is, should I decline the offer, should I take the offer and only work for 2 weeks, or should I work on the weekend and maybe end up burnt out and depressed?

Because of college credits from HS (and other factors like the stars literally aligning), it‚Äôs possible for me to cram my bachelors, masters, and minor all in 4 years (yes I‚Äôve confirmed with my advisor). The problem is that while it‚Äôs possible, I‚Äôll have to take a good amount of classes per semester and will likely be stressed and overworked.

On the flip side, I could spread it out in 5 years but I would have alot of extra time/unecessary elective slots to fill in order to keep certain scholarships.

"Just turned 17, feeling unsuccessful and worrying about the future","please respect my post, I'd gladly appreciate it 


I hope im in the right subreddit. Lately I've been feeling short or like I haven't achieved goals in life like everyone else has. I also feel like I haven't been making new connections for a while and is feeling stagnant. Also haven't been getting them high remarks, and the highest general average I could get was 89 while everything else was ranging from 81-90+. I'm not sure if starting a side career just for popularity (by starting a youtube channel) would help me a bit reach some people I'd like to give or have informations in between, kind of like I wanna build a community as I feeling left out, or probably not but still continue creating a channel alone without all of that stuff, just by letting it grow by itself. 

Honestly, since quarantine dropped back in 2020, it has affected me ever since, like I've been failing to keep connections, keeping focus with someone I am having a chitchat with, and eye contact most importantly. 

The things I am passionate right now is everything about tech and electronics. My main focus lately is trying to be an I.T, but if that didn't worked maybe I should just keep being an electrical engineer which kind of sucks I guess. Or maybe I should be focusing on becoming an electrical engineer first then my failsafe would be becoming an I.T guy? I'm not sure

Second stuffs is being an audiophile as I really like how the early 80s-2000s sounds like for how producers and artists back then cares that much about quality and fidelity. Not because of genres or stuffs like that, but because of how they're so different and original than nowadays, I mean, not that I hate modern stuff, they're great if they're being put into a proper use. Also would like to put a hard mention on quality over quantity like everyone nowadays doesn't do, and is doing the complete opposite. lol

If I move out to another state, the area I would have to reside in is honestly depressing. I would have no friends or family. The setting is very gloomy and empty compared to my hometown. There are seriously no college students. I would be minority (seriously). No people out on the streets enjoying the weather. It's just a quiet town for middle aged people. I just know I would get depressed. 

If I stay in the state I have grown up in my whole life (w/ fam), I feel happy because I have friends here.

Like I won't look forward to work at all. I just feel so stuck and sad because both choices would have its cons. Any advice?

The tricky thing is that I already signed the job offer with the L&D hospital. But now that I am looking for apartments and getting a feel of the town, I feel like I don't fit in.

I took a gap year out of high school, started bartending at 18, was making great money.

Fast forward a few years I got my A.A. Dec. 23‚Äô, (yes I know it took me a minute but I was a part time student and part time worker) I flip flopped between my career path and eventually landed on radiology. I applied to one program and by the grace of god I got accepted. 
I‚Äôm so thankful and grateful to be presented this opportunity, because the last three years I‚Äôve been wanting to get out of the restaurant industry and into an actual career with steady pay, benefits, consistent hours etc. 
With all that being said, I have help from my parents where they can provide, but I don‚Äôt have the privilege to straight up quit my job while in the program. And they can‚Äôt straight up pay for my program and everything on top of it for me. On top of all that this program is $1,500 per semester (there‚Äôs five semesters). Not including paying for my own books, scrubs, etc. 
This program is physically demanding with 5 day, 40 hour weeks of clinicals and classes. I know in my mind I can really do this thing and stick it out for that ending I‚Äôve always wanted. 
I just really am looking for a peace of mind that this will all pay off in the long run. I understand the program itself isn‚Äôt asking for an arm and a leg per se but I‚Äôm anxious and stressed about being in debt for the first time in my life. 
By no means am I saying that the restaurant industry isn‚Äôt an actual career field, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve never wanted to stay in for the long run. I‚Äôve loved working in this industry for as long as I have, I‚Äôve built great hospitality skills and met many amazing people, so please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm shitting on the restaurant industry in any way because I would not be where I am today without it.

"Dating app frustrations","I (43 m) deleted all of the dating apps that I was on and below are my thoughts.

Facebook Dating - I met the most long lasting people on here - I actually became friends with a couple of the women on this app.  The advantages of fb dating is that you can see their profiles sometimes if they are mutual friends and see what they look like or how they kind of are in real life. The plus side also is that FB Dating is free.

Bumble - I met 6 women here - 2 of which I still talk to.

Hinge - I matched with several women but never met anyone.

Tinder - I matched with a couple of women but never met them.

Stir - I used the app briefly - there aren‚Äôt many users in my area so I didn‚Äôt match with anyone.

I‚Äôve used them off and on for 2 years - made some connections - but no relationships or dates really.

All dating apps are designed to keep you on the platform as long as possible and are all designed (except fb dating) to get you to spend money (at least on the men‚Äôs side).

The only one that really wins on dating apps is the apps from what I‚Äôve see.

I‚Äôd say about 30% of the ‚Äúwomen‚Äù I‚Äôve seen were fake profiles. It‚Äôs pretty obvious with Facebook dating because you can tell the ai pictures and then once in a while you see a picture of a guy on the last profile picture. It‚Äôs kind of funny, like the scammer puts in his own picture as one of the pictures lol.

So you have actual fake profiles and then you have ai or weird angles or a lot of edited pictures for the real people.

I met several women who looked nothing like their profile pictures. Like at all, which I don‚Äôt see the point in not showing real, or current, pictures because when we meet it will be obvious if someone is lying.

It‚Äôd be like if a guy said he was 6‚Äô2 and shows up and he‚Äôs 5‚Äô9. It‚Äôd be obvious if he is lying.

I‚Äôve heard from several female friends that they get thousands of swipes and are overwhelmed. Similarly    a lot of men have to swipe hundreds or thousands of times before they have a meeting or date with a match.

I think dating apps create this fallacy that there might be someone better on the next swipe. So sometimes we pass up on a potential match because we think there‚Äôs something better on the other side.

But then everyone ends up alone and lonely.

I have a couple of ideas that I‚Äôm going to be launching.

One of them is a dating tshirt. I‚Äôve done this for myself and have tested it out and it works.

The other is an online forum that sorts by geographic area.

If you have any interest in either of these let me know.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m61t86/dating_app_frustrations/","1753149752.0","Adulting","Darknessbeforedawn24"
"Help","I don‚Äôt even know where to start because this isn‚Äôt just about my siblings‚Äîit‚Äôs about my whole life at this point. But I need advice before I actually lose my mind.

I‚Äôm 23 and still living at home, but it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm lazy or don‚Äôt want to leave‚Äîit‚Äôs because I physically can‚Äôt yet. I‚Äôm broke most of the time because I‚Äôm constantly spending my money to take care of my younger siblings. My mom barely helps at all. She‚Äôs either at work or at her boyfriend‚Äôs house (and trust me, she‚Äôs there more than she‚Äôs here). When she is home, she does nothing but scream at me about how the house needs to be spotless or how the kids need to be taken care of. She‚Äôll threaten to throw me out if the house isn‚Äôt clean enough or if she decides I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot doing enough.‚Äù Meanwhile, she literally does nothing to actually raise these kids or keep things running.

The kids are Zach (18), Dylan (16), Kenzie (13), and Justin (14). They eat like they‚Äôre in a competitive eating contest 24/7. I‚Äôll drop $300+ on groceries, and within a day or two it‚Äôs gone because they‚Äôll literally tear through it like it‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating‚Äîthey act like food is free and I can just magically replace it every time they binge through the kitchen. Half the time, I‚Äôm eating scraps because I have to make sure there‚Äôs enough for them.

On top of that, they won‚Äôt help with anything. No cleaning, no cooking, no chores. If I ask them to help, they ignore me or give me attitude. Dylan will only help if I threaten to take something away, and even then it lasts about five minutes. Zach doesn‚Äôt think he has to do anything because he‚Äôs ‚Äúan adult now‚Äù even though he literally lives here for free and doesn‚Äôt pay for sh*t. Kenzie and Justin couldn‚Äôt care less‚Äîthey‚Äôll sit in their rooms or do whatever they want and leave me to pick up the pieces.

The worst part is, I don‚Äôt want to just let the house fall apart because if I do, my mom will snap and tell me I‚Äôm out. But I can‚Äôt keep being the maid, chef, therapist, and provider either. I‚Äôm just stuck in this miserable middle place where no matter what I do, I lose.

This has basically been my life forever. My mom has never really been a mom to me. She‚Äôs manipulative, mean, and emotionally neglectful. If I try to stand up for myself, she‚Äôll either flip out or play the victim and act like I‚Äôm the problem. I‚Äôve been raising myself‚Äîand them‚Äîsince I was a kid. And now here I am, still doing it, except it‚Äôs ten times harder because everyone‚Äôs older, louder, hungrier, and more selfish.

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm asking anymore. How do I survive this without going crazy? How do I set boundaries when my mom literally threatens to throw me out? How do I get my siblings to respect me at all when they see me as just another person to take advantage of?

Any advice would help, or even just someone to tell me I‚Äôm not insane for feeling like this. Because right now, I feel like I‚Äôm drowning

"How to make College Life more Fulfilling?","Hello! I'm going into my 3rd year of college. I was planning on going into Computer Science, but tbh I haven't been feeling it lately. In fact, I haven't felt ""it"" at all for the large majority of college. My time here has felt unfulfilling. My classes feel like busywork, and I don't feel like I've really learned anything. I've just been checking off boxes so i can get a degree that MIGHT help me find a job later. The rare time I start to feel a spark about anything related to school, it's almost immediately snuffed out by the fact that nobody cares outside of if I'm passing or not. The way people treat it sometime makes it feel like enjoyment comes second, and passing comes first. I've tried to find fulfillment in my hobbies, but like before, it's not something I can ""pass"" or put on a resume, so it comes second.

It's getting to the point where I can't focus on anything because I feel angry and anxious about ""wasting my life away,"" which becomes a self-fulfilling cycle because I fail my classes and have to take them again. I've never been good at studying in the first place, and it's even harder now that my self-confidence is in the gutter. I've done some thinking, and I think this relates back to my feelings around accomplishment. I wouldn't feel this way if it felt like I was doing something ""cool"" or ""important,"" but right now college feels like I'm stressing myself out for no reason. I'm looking for an avenue that gives me work that actually feel like something (i.e. not 9-billion tests on abstract integral problems), and someway I can find a community that also cares about the work we're doing. 

If anyone has any advice on what avenue I should take, I'd love to hear it!","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m629m2/how_to_make_college_life_more_fulfilling/","1753151050.0","college","FishShtickLives"
"I need adult advice please. I'm struggling bad mentally.","hello! i'm making this post in hopes of getting some kind of relief from my anxiety. 

i live in south carolina, i'm 24 years old, and i'm married. last year i did a medicaid application for 18 year old sister that had been living with me since she was 16 (i had legal custody of her) i did the application for only her, not myself as i had health insurance through the healthcare marketplace.

some time went on and one day i randomly got a letter in the mail saying i was signed up for first choice health insurance. i didn't think anything of it, i had done the healthcare marketplace application and already had a plan but i just assumed that since i personally didn't sign up for it that they just found me eligible or something through the marketplace. my sister was signed up for the same plan. i only used the health insurance through medicaid for one thing and one thing only - an eye exam and a pair of cheap medicaid glasses. it said that the insurance covered one exam a year for adults. the insurance was only active for a month before it cancelled on its own for both my sister and i, so i didn't bother cancelling it.

my eye exam was a year ago and now for some reason a couple days ago i get an email from the health insurance marketplace insurance that i had last year at the same time, of them saying that they got my claim for my eye exam from first choice, and they're reaching out to first choice for my information on their W-9. i have absolutely severe OCD and anxiety, and i am absolutely so worried that i somehow committed insurance fraud unintentionally?? the insurance card that i got from medicaid didn't even have my married last name on it, it was my maiden name, but that was the name they last had on file for me because the last time i had medicaid i wasn't married. i also wasn't employed at the time this all occured. can someone please make this make sense for me and reassure me that i'm not gonna go to jail?? i'm so stressed out to the point its all i can think about and i just wanna burst into tears. i'm young and dumb when it comes to this kinda stuff, so please don't be rude.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m63lnh/i_need_adult_advice_please_im_struggling_bad/","1753155002.0","Adulting","bxbyykenz"

"How to calculate how many hours of homework and studying within a course?","I‚Äôm a 2nd B.S Biology student who was overwhelmed with the workload from the 1st year of college. I completed a total of 27 hours my first year. For my first semester of college, I took College Algebra(3 hours), college algebra recitation(0 hours), Texas Government(3 hours), Music Appreciation (3 hours), First Year Seminar(3 hours), and General Psychology(3 hours). These courses kicked my ass since I was still transitioning from high school to college. I learned quickly that learning and applying what you know is crucial than just showing up to lectures and treating college like high school. This spring I took Pre-Calculus(3 hours), Pre-Calculus recitation (0 hours), English II(3 hours), and Intro to Philosophy(3 hours). The workload was manageable but I was still struggling to manage my time. I would try to finish all of my homework for a particular day of class so I could study the same day I finished my homework. I don‚Äôt like breaking down assignments into multiple days, but since that method of grinding homework assignments in one day was not helping, I need to figure out an alternative to managing these assignments along with labs and recitation courses. I‚Äôm now returning into the fall with 7 classes for a total of 12 credit hours. I need 12 credit hours if I want to be considered a full time student. Financial aid is also requiring me to be a full time student at 12 credit hours. I am taking Calculus 1( 3 hours), Calculus 1 Lab(1 hour), General Chemistry 1(3 hours), General Chemistry 1 Lab(1 hour), General Chemistry Recitation(0 hours) General Biology(3 hours), General Biology Lab(1 hour). I am also in a Catholic club that is hosting Bible studies once a week on Fridays for 2 hours. I don‚Äôt know if this is humanly possible but I will give it my best shot to pass all these courses with an A. I also train MMA twice week. Those 2 days out of the week is where I train Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai back to back. Hence, 2 classes one day, and another 2 the next. Each class is an hour long.

"Any advice for a young couple trying to rent an apartment?","Me (M20) and my boyfriend (M20) are planning on getting a place together when we both graduate college in 2 years. I currently live with my parents and he lives alone in an apartment complex at his university (which he doesn't have to pay for since it is part of his on-campus job). I stay over at his place for days at a time at least every weekend so we already have a taste of what living together will be like. It is awesome and we work so well together!!! We rarely ever argue and when we do, it is always short lived and we never stay mad for more than a few hours. I'm not too worried about our relationship lasting when we move in together or anything, I'm more just concerned about how we're going to afford a decent place considering that we live in Los Angeles county and housing costs an arm and two legs. I also would love to bring my two cats with us but I'm not sure how that will work out. As of right now, I make around $1200 a month (it varies) as a restaurant server and my boyfriend will not have a paying job after his summer employment is over but he did just submit a bunch of applications for paid internships. 

If anyone could give us ANY advice I would really appreciate it. Specifically with saving money, renting, keeping good credit, or just anything you wish you had known before you rented your own place for the first time.

The downside, I left with only 45 credits to go.
Back then, I wasn‚Äôt going to school for me,  I was doing it to please my parents, and I was studying something I absolutely HATED. I‚Äôve grown a lot from that point and realized I want to pursue something that actually makes me happy. My mindset now is: life is too short to live with regrets that I can control. If something makes me happy, why deny myself? I‚Äôm seriously thinking about transferring to a different school and enrolling in their online B.S. in Spanish program. It feels more aligned with what I care about. I‚Äôve got a couple of concerns:

1. My low GPA. I left with a 1.89 due to everything I was dealing with mentally. It‚Äôs not a reflection of my actual ability, but I worry it‚Äôll hurt my chances of being accepted.
2. The gap. I‚Äôve been out of school since 2021, and I‚Äôm concerned my old credits might not transfer or still count.

Every event I‚Äôm dedicated to I walk home, wait somewhere for hours to avoid transportation difficulties, beg my family, or pay uber.

I‚Äôm pretty broke because I pay for all my lunch fees and test fees and study materials. Whenever there‚Äôs a school expense, I always have to pay my mom back if she uses her account.
But even my studies been going downhill this year. I used to have a weighted 4.1 -> 4.0 (3.7->3.5 unweighted) because I got a D in hon physics and a C in hon alg2, thought it might change after I finish my summer classes.
My sat score was 1350 and act 30, but it‚Äôs below average.
I‚Äôm definitely sure I have a mental problem, but it‚Äôs not like I can get that diagnosed so there‚Äôs no possibility to justify my stagnation. I‚Äôve been told that writing about trauma is cliche, but nothing else stands out about me.
My parents make a lot of money so I don‚Äôt qualify for financial aid. They don‚Äôt care about what I do so I need to guide them through everything to get them to understand anything related to my school life or grades. They work all the time so I feel bad bothering them.

The last time I was in a relationship was last year, and since then, every date I've been on has been a huge waste of time to the point where I've just stopped asking people out on dates. No idea how to describe it other than it feels transactional, and a lot of Gen Z women I've met refuse to commit and ask for situationships or hookups instead. I still refuse to do that even if it means I have to stay alone.

Don't take this post the wrong way. I've been single for a while, and I'm quite happy staying single, but after dipping my toes into the dating pool for a bit, it makes me worried for the future when I actually do try to find someone to settle down with. It's a bit exhausting to say the least, but I don't know what's causing it.

For me it's not even getting dates that's the problem, it's just finding someone decent from dating that I would commit to AND wants to commit to me, which is surprisingly hard to find.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1m6aqzv/is_dating_still_worth_it_in_this_generation_how/","1753181028.0","GenZ","CharacterAccess770"
"Help w college?","Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, pls lmk and Ill remove it! 

I am autistic, and tend to need more step-by-step instruction on how exactly to do things. How on earth to get into college is definitely one of those things lmao, but none of my friends/family will help, or they just havent gone and dont know how. I spent about 0 of my time worrying about colleges in HS, and know borderline nothing about it. If anyone could help Id really appreciate it! 

I know I want a community college, I have a few nearby ones inmind & prolly a hybrid program. No ideal career inmind, I was thinking just a basic degree (If thats a thing?) (Also wtf are credit hours? do i need to write that essay or smth,, idk man,,,)

"I (20f) and my bf (22m) live together and I want to live separately or even break up because he isn‚Äôt adult enough","Ill keep it short because Im rly exhausted. 

My boyfriend and I met a year ago. Im very independent and have been through a lot. He is the only man that has been treating me with pure intentions in my life & I love him.
The issue is that he is really traumatised. 
His mom and whole family are horrible criminals and drug addicts. He has been heavily neglected until I met him. 
Unfortunately I did not understand the extent of his trauma until we moved in together, it has been 3 months since. 
He has huge issues being an adult in general. 
No sense of responsibility, he forgets due dates, important chores, loses his jobs & doesn‚Äôt do the household properly.
We are both autistic & traumatised and I had A LOT of understanding until now. 
He also is a pathological liar of some sort & lies every time he is scared to tell the truth. If its to make himself look better or hide flaws of his. 
Though he NEVER has been the violent kind, he doesn‚Äôt watch adult movies & he is extremely respectful towards women. 
He also has many qualities I appreciate. 

Two months into living together he lost his job and Ive been working 2 damn jobs (24/7) to keep us fed & a roof over our heads. 
He doesn‚Äôt make a big enough effort to find a job or take work off of my shoulders. 
Honestly he is just making it worse times ten‚Ä¶ 
I constantly remind him and its literally like Im his mom. He acts like a damn teenager too. 

He blames his issues on the fact that he needs time to learn how to be an adult & that he is really depressed. But today he lied to me again about making a VERY IMPORTANT appointment & I lost it. 

To make things clear Im disabled, have 2 jobs and shouldn‚Äôt even be working more than 60%. 
He owes me so much money atp and I cannot pay the rent to this apartment on my own. 
I feel my body shutting down and Im TERRIFIED of being homeless again. 
(Im 20 and its been about 2 years of me having a roof over my head) 

Today I told him Ill kick him out tonight & he can sort out himself where he sleeps. He has no family or friends. It breaks my hard but he always pulls the victim card and I cant do it anymore. 
Not even 3 months into playing house I have to leave my first actually nice ‚Äúhome‚Äù
Im devastated. 
Do you think I should pull through? Moving will financially ruin me again lol. 

Is it a bad idea to keep dating a nonfunctional adult while moving out? Like separating but staying together? 
I really like him & what is below that trauma and we have a lot of similarities.

"ppl r hating on me bc they think I'm a nepo","I got a paid position at a lab (biotech, bme)(also a small company, hence the hire), and people think that I got it through connections. But in reality, I spent every single night writing cold emails to over 40 professors and companies just hoping for some sort of reply. Only one person offered. So i took it. It doesn't make it any better that I am an upcoming sophomore in high school because apparently I am wayyy too young to get this position through pure hard work. I have the skills that they needed, so they hired me. What is so wrong with that? My cousin gave me the idea of cold emailing profs, but that's all. I did the work my self. And when I tell ppl that, they are blinded by the word 'cousin' and think they did all the work, even when I clearly said I typed up all the emails myself. I was talking to my friend, and they said ppl were talking about me and how I got this job through 'connections' and calling me a nepo kid. 

Research has become a popular ec for many people just to get into a t20 or ivy. But for the high schoolers who acc enjoy it we get hate from others because of assumptions, especially at my school. Obviously the kids who get a position from their parents or go to a extremely expensive research camp that does the work for u are the real nepo teens. I just don't understand why I am getting so much hate for something I genuinely enjoy doing. 

On a side note this was just supposed to be a summer job but ive been given projects that could last up to a year (publications) and I really want to take it on and complete it. Im not sure if I should continue to work during school bc im taking a lot of honors and 2 aps + other ecs/sports or just end this in the summer.

"I Had To Drop A Class","The nice woman that helped me choose my classes recommended that I take a summer class. Worst decision of my life. 

I suffered with class, screamed and cried over it. It wasn‚Äôt very mature and I do suffer from mental problems that impair my ability to think straight. 

I decided with the choices I had, I would drop it. I went to my community college and talked with the counselor and got things done. She decided that dropping the class would be better. It was much better than taking the F. 

For context, this was a summer math class. I had less time to do it and not the right help.

I was so far behind and I wasn‚Äôt understanding the class.

I‚Äôm happy that I dropped this class! It was causing so much stress. I know I have to take it again some time but at least now I can enjoy the rest of my summer.

I also learned a valuable lesson. DO YOUR WORK. I was so far behind because I was slacking off. I‚Äôll never do that again

"Feeling Really Stressed About Lack of ECs as a Rising Senior","Looking at this sub and people around, I'm kind of realizing how little time I have left in high school and how I kinda fucked up. Like, I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack because I feel like I‚Äôve built up a decent profile in other areas, but my extracurriculars are where I really fall short. And the problem is that ECs are kind of everything, and that's the one space I did horribly at. Like during freshman and sophomore years, I honestly didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to be doing. I‚Äôm not trying to make excuses, but all I had were a few participation-type clubs, nothing meaningful. When I finally tried to focus during junior year, I felt like it was too little, too late. Now, especially since I‚Äôm aiming for something like pre-med, I feel like my ECs are just too weak, and that I‚Äôve already ruined my chances. It‚Äôs honestly overwhelming. I‚Äôm just wondering: are weak extracurriculars really the end of the road when it comes to getting into a good top 25 school? Like the more I look around me the more I feel stressed.

"Do I Quit Or Stay For a LOR?","Hi! So, I'm doing this IRL lab internship nearby, and it has a LOT of students (almost everyone from my school goes here), and it's cool because you learn real lab skills and do your own project and it's really hands-on. I've been here this whole year and I led my own project, was really involved, and went to research conferences.

  
But, the advisors are really mean (mine is nicer but still üò≠) and it's a REALLY big time commitment. Especially since I'm going into Junior Year.

I don't think I'm going to get a paper out of it, which I originally thought I would. But, after a while I realized I would just do it for the skills and experience.

Now, I've when to conferences, and learned a BUNCH of different lab skills (which are really cool!!) but I don't think it's worth the time commitment and mental stress anymore.

The only reason I would stay is for a Letter of Rec from my advisor, but he does them based on participation. While he likes me right now, I know I won't be in lab as much throughout the school year, so I'm not sure if I would even get a good letter in the end?

And the seniors under my advisor didn't end up at the best schools either, so I'm not sure if this is even as important to apps as I thought. (The other advisor sends many kids to T20s, but they also publish a LOT more.)

However, if I leave then the other activities I'm doing are kinda just ""ideas"" for passion projects right now, so I'm worried I'd be ditching something valuable and end up regretting it.

Sorry it's so long but TL;DR:

Should I stay in this lab, with a low chance of publishing (but not zero?) and the potential to get a LOR (but it would be a BIG time commitment). OR, do I quit and focus on other things?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m6373p/do_i_quit_or_stay_for_a_lor/","1753153786.0","ApplyingToCollege","ClassicPassionSlice"
"How to move on from not being able to attend dream school for whatever reason and settling for CC","Hey guys. I'm currently committed to community college but feel like caca. I got into UCLA, UC Berkeley, and a couple other good schools but spent every waking moment of high school thinking about college etc. I got into Northwestern too and committed but pussied out because it seemed like it was going to be a little pricy but not meaningfully (like over 4 years maybe 30 grand more) + I have a complicated family situation (single parent with limited family support around who is unstable health wise and has stage 3 cancer) and I got super scared of being far from home in general for no reason. I decommitted in June after my mom got bad test results and I was just under an insane amount of pressure and felt so overwhelmed. I asked multiple times if they could reinstate me after the fact and they were well aware of my situation but they refused as well.

I just got the craziest amount of cold feet basically even though it was my dream for years, Idk what came over me. I've only been out of state once.
Not only did I limit myself in terms of my career prospects (l'd like to go into business), but I always wanted to gtfo of LA and Northwestern was my dream school since I was a jit. It's genuinely made me depressed . I've gained 20 pounds this summer and am not excited about college at all just stressed and depressed and like I've seriously limited myself.

i‚Äôm good at the job, haven‚Äôt really had any huge drawbacks. i‚Äôve gone through training smoothly and have gotten good scores at the end of each day the whole time. all of my coworkers/trainers/supervisors say i‚Äôm smart and i‚Äôm great at it. i‚Äôm not trying to brag or anything of course, i‚Äôve made mistakes just like everyone but i‚Äôm trying to say that i‚Äôm not reconsidering because i‚Äôm struggling with training or anything.

all of my other jobs were very hands-on, i worked with animals for years but decided to leave because i got incredibly burnt out with it and wanted something different. so i applied for this job and got it! i was so happy to have something different and i like all of my coworkers, plus the 10-hour shifts are nice.

however‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm going absolutely stir-crazy in the dispatch center. my city is usually not incredibly busy, so there will be pretty long periods of time that i‚Äôm just kinda sitting there occupying myself until i get a call or an officer/firefighter says something. my coworkers all kinda seem content about sitting quietly at their desks, which is fine but i‚Äôm struggling with it. i tried to combat this by walking around the room, but my trainer said i took to long to get back to the desk when an officer said something, so now i‚Äôm just sitting.

i can‚Äôt stand being stuck in the same room all day with no fresh air or anything. i‚Äôm also afraid i‚Äôm gonna gain weight/have health issues from being sedentary for long periods of time. i try to occupy myself with reading, writing etc but i‚Äôm just so incredibly bored. i can‚Äôt imagine doing this routine for many years. is this a normal feeling? i‚Äôm terrified of night shift because it‚Äôs going to be dark, quiet, i‚Äôll be tired, there will only be one other person there.

hi everyone. i‚Äôm posting this along with my amazon wishlist in hopes of getting help with some things i genuinely need but can‚Äôt afford on my own. i know times are tough for a lot of people right now, so thank you just for reading. i‚Äôm on disability for: crohn‚Äôs disease, depression, anxiety, CPTSD, PG, and autism. i make just enough to keep my lights on and my rent paid with my check, anything extra goes to my cats first. i feel like i should make it clear that i didn‚Äôt decide ‚Äúoh let me just go get 2 cats, it‚Äôs fine i‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù they were in danger and i couldn‚Äôt let them stay in that situation. rest assured i make sure they have plenty of food, water, and litter. they even have some dollar tree toys that a friend dropped off to me. i don‚Äôt have a car, and i‚Äôm struggling with some type of agoraphobia because leaving the house has become almost impossible. 

before anyone asks‚Äîyes, i‚Äôve tried every local resource available to me.
i‚Äôve reached out to local churches, furniture banks, food pantries, and community organizations in my area. unfortunately, most programs don‚Äôt have funding or support unless you have minor children living with you. single adults‚Äîeven disabled ones like me‚Äîtend to fall through the cracks.

i do get food pantry deliveries sometimes, which i‚Äôm grateful for, but a lot of the food i receive contains things i medically can‚Äôt eat. i end up giving away about half of what i‚Äôm sent. i also now have an abundance of items i don‚Äôt need, like puppy pads and toothbrushes, because they come in every pantry box even though i don‚Äôt have a dog or kids.

about domestic violence help:
i‚Äôve also tried to get support from a local DV shelter, but i wasn‚Äôt eligible because:
	1.	i left my abuser while he was at work instead of involving the police‚Äîwhich is safer for many of us. but if there‚Äôs no current or active police report, they won‚Äôt offer shelter or services.
	2.	even if i had called the police, the local DV shelter was so full they were going to send me 45 minutes away to a different one i‚Äôd already been to. i can‚Äôt go back there because i was caught sneaking out at night to return to him. (i‚Äôve since left for good.)

if you‚Äôve made it this far‚Äîthank you. truly.
i‚Äôm just trying to survive and make my space more livable and safe. if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. i‚Äôm happy to answer. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Worried about workload! Advice needed/wanted!","I currently plan on taking 16 credits (five, sixteen week long classes) next semester: BIO-110 (4 credits, required, lab-based), SPA-111 (3 credits, required, Elementary Spanish), ENG-112 (3 credits, writing/research), PSY-237 (3 credits, social psychology), and PHI-215 (3 credits, philosophy). I am starting to worry this might be too much, especially with BIO-110‚Äôs labs, and could use your advice! I want to make sure I graduate on time and stay in my graduating class year, so I know that having a larger, more intense workload for one semester is worth it; I just don't want to get overwhelmed.

**Background**: I got an A in high school biology, and I‚Äôve been told BIO-110 is similar to high school level, so I feel okay, but nervous about the labs. I‚Äôm strong in writing (love ENG-112‚Äôs focus) and critical thinking (excited for PHI-215 and PSY-237). I have some psychology background, which helps with PSY-237, and A1 Spanish skills (from Duolingo) for SPA-111, which is great for my career goals. School is my only focus - no job, just casual hobbies (crocheting, learning Korean for fun). I‚Äôm motivated to push through for law school, but don‚Äôt want to burn out.

**Questions**:

* Has anyone taken a 16-credit load with a lab science like BIO-110? How did you manage the labs alongside humanities/social science classes?
* Any tips for staying organized with five classes and balancing study time (especially for biology labs, writing essays, and psych readings)?
* Any strategies to avoid stress with a heavy semester?

"Is it wise to ask my parents NOT to pay for my college?","I'm currently in community college and it's been.. mediocre. I was a 3.5+ GPA person for most of HS, but my second semester of college hit me like a truck. I fell apart without a pre-built system and failed ALL of my classes. Ever since then, I've been trying to rebuild my GPA, but I still have a few classes I put off and then eventually drop or fail. I lost a scholarship, regained it, then lost it again. I've had to do trial and error with online, class loads, studying, etc. just to figure out how to be decent again. I still get C's.

I had always suspected something was up with me, but didn't get diagnosed and medicated until recently. I do think that meds will help me for next semester, but.. I'm not confident that I'll do great like I need to. I can notice patterns. I love learning (whatever I'm fixated on at the time, anyways) and I have a clear cut path in mind. I even have backup degrees, and if THOSE don't work out, I have plans for a non-college career. I want to make money and provide for myself and my partner. I want to be an academic again... but for some reason, I seem to lack this, ""inner drive."" Even if I NEED to finish something, even if I NEED to focus, I just fumble it. (And before anyone asks, I have depression and have been on meds for a while. I have hope for life and want that ideal future to be real, so I don't feel like it's the depression, but who knows.)

My parents have offered to pay for my debt in the future on the condition that I stay in college, and so far they've paid for the portion of my classes not covered by my scholarship, but... the more I think about it, the more I feel like I can't accept it. Truthfully, I'm spoiled and selfish. I'm used to my parents bailing me out of difficult situations, like paying for my failed semester even when they were obviously upset at me. I'm used to them being soft on me due to my mental illness. Of course I feel guilty, but beyond that, I've developed a hypothesis that I really need to take on that debt for myself. I need to have immediate consequences for failure to do my work. 

Of course, the concept makes me nervous, especially in the current economy. I tried to take a gap semester following my failed semester to figure myself out and my parents refused. They pointed to my aunt, who's still paying off tens of thousands of loans decades after dropping out. That scared me, but I feel like I needed to be. I don't want to even live with the mindset of ""my parents will bail me out later"" because I know myself and I know that I will inevitably take advantage of it.

Has anyone else experienced a dilemma like this or decided to take on their own loans? How did you go about it, how did you tell your parents? Would I be making the wrong choice?

"gym makes me feel miserable","a bit of a vent to get off my chest. i feel like my mental health goes in the trash every time i leave the gym. going to the gym makes me forget about other things going on in my life that I'm stressing out on but instead it gets replaced with other negative thoughts. 

I started the gym last year for improving my fitness, health and appearance. I don't feel i have made much significant progress. my progress in strength and weights is not growing well. I've tried everything - from trying to increase in weights, to progressive overload to starting more reps in lower weights etc. I hate that I'm so weak and I hate that my brain can't even grasp simple instructions or imitate what others are doing. my body goes against every form I don't get it. I hate being dyspraxic and having co-ordination motor issues.

i feel completely blocked and plateaued and nothing is helping me. even after I've made countless posts on beginner threads but nothing is ever sticking. I've practiced so much but I can never get the forms correctly, videos do not help and I can't afford a PT. I cant keep track of my diet and every time I eat I feel horrible that I'm wasting any exercise I've done. i hate seeing myself in the mirror and random reflections. I cant sleep very well. I'm just a big fat failure and I can't do anything right. I always suck at my sets - I do well on the first but always always get worse in the following ones - regardless if I go too heavy or light. I hate being so weak.

I still blindly go three times a week hoping something will change but I feel like I'm being held back and I can't get past any barriers. I feel absolutely defeated every time I leave the gym and I feel trash about my own body and appearance.

I don't know when or if I'll not feel so horrible after the gym. it just always comes and I feel I can't celebrate much small wins when it takes just a glance at the mirror or someone making a comment. I just feel garbage, lost and directionless. there is probably deeper issues in my life other than the gym making me feel this way too tbh

My mental health was horrible, I had a lot going on at home and my chem teacher was on maternity leave so it put the class in an iffy spot. I tried getting extra help during study hall to no avail. 

At my school you need at least three years of a science to fulfill your graduation requirements. The following semester I took cp physics and got an 86. I want to go into medicine (probably something related to behavioral science). I‚Äôm questioning if I should even go into this because I haven‚Äôt taken any STEM based ap‚Äôs (mostly humanities with the exception of AP CSP) and my test scores aren‚Äôt that great. 

Up until 8th grade I also had an IEP for math‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to set myself up for failure in college but I‚Äôm not the strongest in other subjects either. Across the board I‚Äôm mostly just a B student whether it‚Äôs in a cp, honors, or AP. I know that this will raise red flags to admission officers and I have no idea what to do.

"Does anyone else feel discouraged whenever they see another post/announcement of a friend/coworker/former classmate their age getting married?","I'm 24. I know that 24 still very young. And honestly, even though I would like to have a romantic partner partner and get married one day, I don't feel like I'll be ready for marriage until at least another 6 years from now. I don't feel like I'll be ready to have kids until another 10 years from now. 

Occasionally, on my social media, I'll see people announce their proposal or them getting married.And if I'm still in contact with them, I'm happy for them. If not, I just wish him well and go on about my day. But I will admit that there's a part of me that gets worried. Because even though I know that I still have time, it takes a long time to establish a relationship. And for that person to get married to you. And have kids with that person.

And you know, I guess its fine because I was a minor but I literally couldn't even go see my friends without her flipping out every which way I went. Like I literally stopped off at a gas station one time and she started freaking out thinking I was trafficked. So I stopped hanging out with friends. And she would track it when I wasn't driving home soon enough for my curfew at 10...and talked about my speed all of the time. I turned it off at 18. Recently I let her back on because I thought it would be good for safety reasons. And she's been abusing her privledges again...even if I uber. All of the time, ""you were up late last night,"" ""where were you,"" ""I saw you went there,"" etc. Really pisses me off.

"I'm good at math, but i hate math class, how can I make homework more bearable","I'm coming up on my Junior year and have to take ap precalc, which comes packaged with a required summer assignment of previous year's (algebra 2) review. I cant opt out of this because I either cant go backwards or its just socially unacceptable to regress in math courses or something  
What makes it worse is that I already know that i want to become an animator (specifically hand drawn), which, very obviously, barely uses math, so all math is to me is stuff that's barely related to real life, besides the off mention of something like compound interest that gets 10 minutes of focus. All it feels like math is is just doing what random instructions the teacher tells you to do to some random abstract numbers and you get the answer (whoopdie doo)  
This line of thinking is probably flawed but school doesn't give me a reason not to think this way.  
And when i get hours of homework to do, it feels like a waste of time that could be used to actually improve at the skills I need for the job I want.   
And sometimes when I'm an hour+ into math homework it even reminds me about everyone's impending mortality *but* *that's fine...*   
It also activates the procrastinator in me and I end up avoiding my math homework and personal art projects by playing games

My university is a really good school but it‚Äôs about 90k a year so I would love to save a full year of tuition. I was just wondering, in this situation, how do grad activities and everything work? I‚Äôm worried that during my ‚Äúsenior year‚Äù I‚Äôll be all alone in senior activities bc the class I‚Äôm starting with will be graduating a year later. So how does stuff like that work in college? Is it normal to be friends with people outside of ur grade? I don‚Äôt wanna sit alone at graduation or anything lolll.

"Struggling","Hey there everyone. Here is a rundown. I'm 21. I've already been enrolled into 2 colleges, and dropped out. I've never been good academically, no special scholarships (besides FAFSA Grants) to pay for tuition, no parent that can help financially support it, but I still took a vow (to myself) to get a degree sooner, rather than later.

2022, I moved on campus to a Trade School. At the time, I was dealing with the loss of my brother, and ended up dropping out a month into classes. (I actually just finished paying off my loans last year, from the 1 month I was there)

This past year, I enrolled in Online Classes (due to the fact that I have a full time job that I cannot give up to attend classes in person) and those classes have also, since, been dropped. And with how they were sat up to be ""self paced"", it made it extremely difficult for me. And if I were to go back to college, it would be in person....

I'm looking for literally anything y'all have. Tips, experiences and solutions, outcomes, anything. 

Thank y'all.

"31 y/o brother has never left home","My younger brother has been concerning me. He‚Äôs 31, has never left home and has $10k to his name. It‚Äôs not a lot of money when he works full time and doesn‚Äôt pay any bills (my parents take $100 a month from him for his cell phone and $90 for his share of the utilities) he has minimal debt (I believe about ~2k in student loans as he went to CC and had Pell grants) and no cc debt. 

I‚Äôm not sure how he only has $10k saved up with no bills and making $34ish an hour. It seems he smokes a lot of weed, has recently started doing shrooms, so I assume a lot of his money goes to that and tattoos. He always talks about saving to move out and when I‚Äôve offered to help him figure out a life plan (rents are expensive in NY but I‚Äôve told him a decade ago to save so he can buy a home) he tells me he has it figured out and the 1 year plan becomes 2, then becomes 3 etc.

My parents are aging, trying to figure out their own next plan with retirement and selling their home but have started to wonder if they should include him in their plans since he shows no effort in being an adult and responsibilities. His time at home is spent playing video games and smoking. He has a good heart and I want the best for him but I am struggling with the prospect of him never growing up and learning how to adult and my parents passing. I‚Äôm not sure what would be next for him at that point. 

Any advice on how to encourage him to adult at this point? Tips on how to bring this concern up to my parents?

Anyways this is the background info i had no one to room with at the college I chose i was scared of having a random roommate so i knew a few friends also going to the same school (4 hours from my home town) so when they asked me to room with them i said yes. Im going to be a freshman and out apartment is 1 block off campus but its still student housing just not dorms.

Now im not sure how many people can relate but they are the type of friends to say that and not mean it just to mess around but now im nervous incase he and other roommates do try stuff i dont want it to interfere with my life plans (college, work) i work from home on the computer and often have video calls and chats.

One thing im scared of is that hell say offensive things or be blasting loud music on his dj set and board hes bringing down and this could get me in trouble with work. Another fear of mine is him stealing from me or going into my room and messing with my things. Another fear is him taking it to far and harassing me by touching me and throwing things at me (we always would joke around but I‚Äôm scared he might take something to far) another fear of mine is he has a fake id and i don‚Äôt want to be in trouble if he has drinks or vapes in our room

"How do people make friends as young adults??!","Hey reddit. I (19f) have a very very small group of people I talk to on a semi-regular basis (3-6, none of them know eachother) and I only hang out with any of them maybe once a month. I only work 35 hours a week. I try to go out, but I feel like there‚Äôs not much to do socially at this age that‚Äôs not as expensive as a concert ticket.
For some context, I moved around a LOT as a kid. I never developed any serious long-term friendships; I had two childhood best friends, but one lives over five hours away and we talk once a year, whereas the other girl and I stopped speaking when she began to abuse hard substances when we were 16. Covid happened my freshman year of highschool and I didn‚Äôt go back until my Junior year, where I got involved with a couple notorious girls that got me into some harder stuff while i was going through a lot at home. i lashed out on my peers and tried to come off as untouchable. as a result of that, I built myself a pretty poor reputation around my school as an unhinged user. since graduation in 2023. i went to university for a semester, but got roofied and assaulted by a boyfriend, which dug me deeper into substances. I became an addict and dropped out after a couple more incidents before going into recovery about a year and a half ago. 
I‚Äôve cut off all of the people from my past life and have been trying desperately to get a social life started again. I try to meet new people through social media, work, even some low-key parties or rave community gatherings but it feels like it‚Äôs impossible to connect with anyone. I‚Äôve always gotten along with people older than me, so I honestly find it hard to relate to or engage with people my age. But it feels like people over 21 don‚Äôt want to be friends with me because I can‚Äôt go out to most things they do, since most people I meet are ravers. I love to draw, I love to go camping, I love to explore my spirituality. I don‚Äôt just like raving. I try to connect with all kinds of people tbh. It just always feels like the other person is trying to avoid building a connection with me no matter what i do. 
How do people meet others at this age when you‚Äôre not in college? I feel so stuck. Where do you go that doesn‚Äôt cost like $25-200 for entry?

"Considering withdrawing since I cannot pay my college tuition, any advice I can do to prevent such?","Hello,   
  
As my title says, I am starting to consider withdrawing from my university as I am starting to grapple with the fact that I will most likely not be able to pay for my upcoming semester tuition. My previous year was my first year of college and it already took a bunch of money out of me, I don't know how I will be able to continue to afford to attend university as any funds I have are already low.   
  
My family can barely help me out here, we are not a well off family and are already stretched thin with having payments and bills. Only my stepfather works and my mother is unable to work or provide assistance due to a medical condition as well as needing to take care of our grandmother who recently underwent surgery and will be going right back under soon for a transplant.  
  
Even with financial aid and subsidized loans, the amount left to pay (around 3k USD) has me wondering where I could get the money from. The only option I have in front of me is a work-study option but I feel as if doing work and the amount of classes I will take this semester will negatively impact my grades. I barely get any scholarships too, and I refuse to take out any more loans that I already have, not to mention I don't want to have to burden my family even more with what they already have to worry about.  
  
If I withdrawl, I don't know when I'd even return to my university, I just hope that if I do so, I can land a job soon and save money for when I can return. My grades are in good standing so its not like I'd be leaving on bad academic terms. I'm just putting this out there just in case anyone could have some advice for me. I'm still young and just a year out of highschool.

I never flossed growing up ‚Äî my family just didn‚Äôt talk about it. I learned about it at 14 when I got braces. After they were removed, my teeth looked okay but always felt like they had an odd ‚Äúlayer‚Äù on them.

I didn‚Äôt get a cleaning after COVID due to lack of insurance. A few months ago, I finally went and had my teeth cleaned ‚Äî they felt light and smooth again. But the dentist said I had¬†**7 cavities**¬†and¬†**weak enamel**.

Now, a few months later, my teeth feel the same as before ‚Äî like they‚Äôre coated or not clean. I‚Äôm confused because I:

* Brush¬†**2‚Äì3 times daily**
* Floss every day
* Use¬†**Colgate high-fluoride toothpaste**¬†(prescribed by my dentist)
* Use¬†**Colgate mouthwash**
* Wear a¬†**retainer every night**
* **Use straws**¬†for tea/coffee
* **Rarely drink soda**¬†now (though I used to be addicted for a year)
* **Don‚Äôt smoke**¬†and¬†**rarely drink alcohol**
* Don‚Äôt have my¬†**wisdom teeth**, and likely never will

I'm 25 and feel completely stuck. I'm currently working as a forklift driver in the UK, earning decent money, and l've managed to save up a bit. On paper things seem alright-but mentally, I'm not where I want to be. I don't even know where that is.
Lately, l've been torn between two options: ‚Ä¢ Buy a house and ""settle"" a bit financially (even though I'm not sure I want to stay where I live now) ‚Ä¢ Use my savings to upskill - either get trained on more plant machinery (360s, cranes, etc.) or look into qualifications for a different kind of job entirely.
Deep down, I know I want more out of life. Not just more money, but better experiences, more freedom, purpose.
I've even thought about working abroad someday-but again, I have no idea where to start. I don't have a plan. I just feel like I'm floating.
Part of me feels like I'm wasting time in a job that won't take me where I want to be. But then again, I don't even know what ""where I want to be"" looks like. It's like I'm standing at a crossroads but all the signs are blank.
I've thought about therapy, but I don't think it would really help with this kind of directionless feeling. I don't feel depressed-just lost.

"I feel stuck at home with a passive father, no income, and no direction ‚Äî Is moving out or changing cities even possible for someone like me?","I'm 31 years old, and for the last 8+ years, I‚Äôve been living with my father after my mother passed away. Ever since her death, my father has shown no intention of discussing life, the future, or making any sort of plan ‚Äî not for himself, and definitely not for me.

He spends most of his time at the gurudwara and usually returns late. If I try to talk about what to do next or where our lives are headed, he just stays silent. And when I get frustrated and raise my voice, I‚Äôm the one blamed for being rude. Once in anger, I said things I regret ‚Äî and now he uses that as emotional leverage, saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell your relatives how you talk to me.‚Äù

But the truth is: for the first year after my mother died I waited for him to step up, to say anything. He never did. I asked him- what's plan now as there's no one to cook food and no income to buy food everyday.  

Out of survival, I tried freelancing ‚Äî blog writing, social media work, even got a few clients. But to keep going, I sacrificed my food and sleep to cut my food down to one meal a day. After 2‚Äì3 years of doing that, my health gave up ‚Äî I ended up with digestion issues and constant burnout. I then took a course hoping to upskill, but got into ‚Çπ20k debt, now 50k. I couldn‚Äôt repay it, so I asked my father for help. He gave me the money to pay the emi, but when I try to talk to him again and again same response. And, now there's another, saying ‚ÄúI gave you ‚Çπ20,000, no one even gets water in this world.‚Äù

He came home with langar since 7 years and he just place it on my bed when I am not home or around. It feels like I‚Äôm just existing in this house ‚Äî not living. Like I‚Äôm being tolerated, not supported. Just being allowed to stay and eat, and that‚Äôs supposed to be enough.

Now I feel drained. I don‚Äôt want to do freelancing anymore. I‚Äôve already tried. I don‚Äôt have any income. I have no savings. And mentally I feel stuck.:

I want to move out ‚Äî either rent a place, or shift to another city to find work. But I have no money, not any high income skill, yes I wrote so many words SEO blogs, grew IG pages but now it feels like a huge task to me and it doesn't generate income fast and stable and no one to back me.
I‚Äôm not lazy ‚Äî I‚Äôve done the grind. But is it even possible to break this loop without resources?
I am having sui**dial thoughts all the time, once even tried but stopped. (Took help of chatgpt to get words together as it's huge task to me to write and I was confused on what to do now)

Can someone like me ‚Äî with no savings, no backup ‚Äî move to another city and actually survive?

Are there ways to get a basic job that atleast not burden mentally or atleast pay goodthat covers rent and food, while I rebuild slowly?

Or should I stay in this situation and wait till I figure out a remote option again?

"So how exactly does one go about ""putting themselves out there?""","So I'm a 28 year old guy with basically no friends, and recently I've moved out on my own. That was my first big goal for myself.

Next I wanna meet people. Maybe meet someone to date, maybe not, but in general I just wanna have friends. Because as it stands I have two friends, both from High School, and neither of who are really available for things because they've been making these big strides in life. We kinda talk here and there, go out on occasion, but for the most part we're more friends because we don't want to lose that ""high school friend"" more so than because we actually do stuff together. I've also never been in a relationship.

I realize the reason for this is mostly myself. I just don't ""put myself out there."" I'm always worried I'm bothering people because any time I approach people, even in settings where it should be acceptable, I'm met with the side-eye stare and a very tepid, non-committal reply.

And I think a lot of that is because I don't really know *how* to ""put myself out there""

People always say go to bars, but I don't enjoy drinking and partying, and I mean, people are there with their friends. They don't want some random schmuck walking up and inserting himself into their chat.

People also always say to join a group based on your hobbies, but unfortunately my hobbies (Writing and gaming primarily) are all very insular. And there isn't really anything else that interests me. I don't want to just sign up for a class or something that I don't want to do because I don't want to make myself more miserable. Plus - and this is the real kicker - I don't exactly have a ton of money. I have enough to survive and slightly more, but I couldn't afford to take a class or anything like that.

I guess I'm just at a loss for what ""putting yourself out there"" really entails aside from lurking around bars and pestering people on the off chance you meet the other antisocial weirdo that nobody wants to talk to. 

So what do people actually *do* when they ""put themselves out there?"" Because the advice of ""just do it"" or ""go to a bar and cold approach people like a weirdo"" don't really work for me. Like, more concretely, what would one do?

I'm really looking to make a change, I just don't know what exactly I'm supposed to do. It's all so foreign to me.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m7h5ap/so_how_exactly_does_one_go_about_putting/","1753295436.0","Adulting","Cirkusleader"

"Class is making me suicidal.","What I am angry about:

- summer classes at my uni are either 6 or 9 weeks, entirely up to the professor. Professor chose to cram 10 weeks of material into 6 weeks.  I knew a 6 week class would be **hard**. However...

- it is an online, ""flipped"" classroom. He does not teach. We are given short lecture videos to watch. He has someone else grade everything. He is open to questions but his office hours clash with my other classes. 

- the lecture videos are almost completely useless. They are good introductory videos (usually around 5-10 minutes per topic) but they are useless when it comes to the exercises, assignments, exams. I have to supplement a LOT with my own learning. I say they are only almost completely useless because he throws in references to his own videos on exams, presumably to make sure we have watched them. 

- this is tangentially related but my mental health is bad. I am depressed and this class sucks any joy out of my life with how much time I need to spend on it. 

- instructions are vague and confusing, rubrics are very harsh and strict. The midterm class average was a 60%. 

Like I said I have no motivation for this class at all. I am suicidal from it. I pay thousands of dollars in tuition for this. I regret it deeply but I can't go back now.

"Need help with my slump","I'm going through an extremely bad slump. It has been so bad since last year and worse than ever this year.
To my defense I had a lot going on in my personal life last year and now it is all good. I can actually put my time for better use.
I work at one of those big companies. I've haven't been doing well. I know exactly why.
I am an instagram addict. I can't keep my phone away. My attention span is now of a 1 month old child.
I stopped paying attention during meetings because I'm busy zoning out involuntarily. My patience level has gone to zero.
In the beginning of this year, I really wanted to get my shit together and i thought I was turning my life around.
But a really unfortunate mistake I made at work put in a really bad spot. I really had no idea it would blow up very badly. I became infamous for this one mistake. It brought me to my lowest point. Like I am questioning my worth.
I feel like things are bad in general for me. Like not with my partner or anything. But I do anything, think anything it is definitely wrong.
I decide to do something I am wrong. Be it cooking, cleaning, work, planning a trip, choosing clothes or anything else, something for the house, something for the family. Anything, you name it I am wrong. My thoughts are wrong, my way of doing is wrong. I put more salt in food. I am kind of killing the house plants.
The new ones aren't growing.
I try to do something good, it becomes disastrous and creates problems that we never needed.
I stopped doing house chores. My partner is taking care of stuff right now.
I went to the gym for one month and did a rigorous diet that month and lost 8 pounds in one month. And I was told that rate of weight loss is bad. So that thing I thought I'm doing right is wrong.
My way of money management is wrong. I thought I had it all figured out. I'm doing it right. But apparently no. My way could bite us very badly in the future.
There is not one thing going right in my life. Whatever is good is only because of my partner. Because somehow my partner is leading an exactly opposite life.
Doing really well at work. Extremely well. House chores. Self control at its best. Gym, diet. Everything perfectly scheduled and being implemented.
Everything is at its best I should say. But me. Oh god.

I'm scared I'll turn into a 100% good for nothing person if I keep this going. I'm going to lose my mind if I don't see some good results.

"Should I even go to college","I want to go to college, and my family supports me, but I‚Äôm worried about two big things: money and whether my academic record is good enough.

I go to a top-ranked high school in my state, but my extracurriculars and course load don‚Äôt reflect that. I started high school dreaming of becoming an animator, but once I realized how risky and unpredictable that career path is, I switched to medicine. That change caught me off guard.

I didn‚Äôt understand the importance of AP classes until late sophomore year. Up until then, I thought I was doing great‚Äîstraight A‚Äôs in mostly honors classes and a few extracurriculars. But I later realized I wasn‚Äôt building much college credit or showing enough academic rigor. My main activity has been JROTC, which I enjoy, but it gives off a military-focused impression that doesn‚Äôt fit who I am ( I can barely lift my body weight, let alone pass basic training in my current state)

I tried to course-correct by taking more rigorous classes. I planned to take two APs and a dual enrollment English class, but scheduling issues left me with just AP Psychology (which I got a 4 on). Now I‚Äôm a senior, Key Club President, and JROTC‚Äôs Security Officer. But with a 26 on the ACT and limited AP classes so far, I‚Äôm nervous about whether colleges will accept me‚Äîor offer enough financial aid.

My family's middle class. My mom‚Äôs a secretary, and my dad's an HVAC tech. They‚Äôre divorced, and though they‚Äôre hopeful I‚Äôll get financial aid (merit and need).

I‚Äôm scared I won't or it won't be enough. I‚Äôm loading up on APs this year to try to improve my chance of admission.

If anyone has advice on how to move forward this year, I‚Äôm open to it.

My dream schools are Howard (administration issues aside) and UNC (but I'm out of state in Louisiana, so that's kind of a pipe dream)","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m7qonl/should_i_even_go_to_college/","1753318798.0","college","KingRickeyReddit"
"My Sister is Homeless and I Am Not.","I‚Äôm (M23) writing this on my older sister‚Äôs birthday, she‚Äôs just now turned 34 and she is either currently or at-risk of being homeless. My sister was living with my Mom for the past few months before past/current grievances with each other soured the situation until it became too much for either of them to handle and my sister got kicked out. To my sister‚Äôs point, I can see how my Mom could be responsible for childhood trauma. But my mom has mellowed out over the years, and I‚Äôve come to know her more as a person than just a parent. In the convos I‚Äôve had with my mom I could tell she was genuinely helping her out by offering her a place (\~600 sq ft) to stay with her dogs and even allowing her to use her spare car.¬†

Things snowballed fast, when my mom went to visit her home country after getting her green card. She was gone for about a month and a half. About a week before my Mom was to return, I got a phone call from my Mom who told me that my sister wasn‚Äôt answering her calls either because something bad happened (my sister has a few mental illnesses she has told our family about and accuses my mom for causing them) or that she was trying to hide that the apartment was ‚Äú*un desastre*.‚Äù I usually don‚Äôt like it when my mom tasks me with things on the spot, but I was also worried something might have happened to her, so I went over. There I found my sister talking loudly on the phone with my mom (my mom threatened to call the police if she didn‚Äôt answer the phone and let me inside the apt) and was angry at my mom for making her late to work (my mom got mixed up with the different time zones). I told my mom to call back later because my sister proved she was still alive. My sister gave me a ride home because she suspected my mom might have caused her to lose her job.¬†

This was the first time seeing the car that my mom kept fairly neat, it was filled to the brim with dog toys, crumpled paper, things glued to the dash and steering wheel, dog hair, and you name it. We would later find that the car carpet(?) was ripped from the steering wheel to the backseat. In the car, my sister told me that the apartment was a mess. She'd been grieving the loss of a friend, but that friend‚Äôs husband was going to help her clean the apartment the next day. At this point I hadn‚Äôt talked to my sister in a while, but I said I could come over and help her clean, just in case the guy is too busy grieving and can‚Äôt make it.

When I came over, I brought my vacuum, some gloves, and a good attitude that I was there to help and not lecture ( Hoarders is one of my favorite shows and so I tried to replicate the strategies they try to teach). I figured if I helped her clean without my mom knowing how much of a mess there was it would save my mom‚Äôs blood pressure and my sister from getting kicked out (no harm no foul?). However, when I walked in there I was hit with a pretty gnarly smell coming from the dogs, the sink, dirty laundry, and joints smoked in the apt. Anything that could be used to eat off of or with was piled in the sink and countertops. My mom let my sister stay in the living room and gave her full use of the front door closet, (which I was surprised by how large it was) but her clothes sort of avalanched from the various tubs she was using to store them in and made it hard to access the door. In addition to all this, the guy she was seeing (I‚Äôll refer to him as Robby) was there. My mom doesn‚Äôt like this guy over because she doesn‚Äôt know him, gets bad vibes, and feels like he is using my sister for a place to crash (he didn‚Äôt have a place either).

After going to the store to get cleaning supplies (my sister didn‚Äôt mention running out of everything and that she was ‚Äúbroke atm‚Äù and would pay me back) I cleaned for a long time and tried hard to not say a criticism. Robby stepped out to ‚Äúdo a job real quick‚Äù or something, and came back to see moved things (tables shifted to vacuum, his tools and box now on the ground and not on the couch, and my sister‚Äôs clothes in the process of being sorted). The closet avalanche sorting was especially messy. My sister has primarily black clothes and a lot of costume stuff (? she likes boudoir or something) and as I was sorting the black dirty clothes with no dog hair from the black dirty clothes with dog hair (almost all had dog hair because they were on the floor) Robby came back. The man who was there and did not help walked in the front door and said, ‚ÄúWow, I didn‚Äôt expect this place to be a disaster when I came back.‚Äù I was kind‚Äôve flabbergasted and asked him, ‚ÄúWhatdoyoumean by that?‚Äù Neither my sister or Robby answered, but pretty soon after that I realized I blew it because each time I tried cleaning it seemed to overwhelm my sister who told me that I had helped a lot, and that she could do the rest herself in the next two days before our mom came back to the states.¬†

The apartment was not cleaned, my mom found out about the car (it took me a full day breakfast-midnight to clean it) took it away from her (my mom figured my sister or the guy was using it to deal and didn‚Äôt want the car to get impounded), and offered a deal to her. That she could stay until the lease ended (2 more months) and didn‚Äôt have to pay rent, she just couldn‚Äôt smoke in the house, needed to pick up after herself, and couldn‚Äôt have the guy over. This was because my sister needed surgery for her hands (nerve damage from several attempts) so that she could continue to work in the future. I‚Äôm not sure if my sister took up the offer, or if my mom overhyped her offer, but my sister doesn‚Äôt have her job anymore (she claims my mom made her lose her job).

My sister couldn‚Äôt meet the expectations, and also the guy, Robbie, wouldn‚Äôt leave and actively ignored my mom. Frustrated, my mom tried to kick her out but my sister basically started squatting in the apt with the dogs and the guy who wouldn‚Äôt leave (she said the dogs and Robbie are the people who have done the most for her). It turned very quickly into a series of cartoonishly petty fights between my mom and my sister. A month-or-so and several occasions of my mom finding dog poo inside in the potted plants later, my sister with nowhere to go moved into a storage unit with Robby (This didn‚Äôt happen quickly and is another story entirely).

Reader, if you are on the kinder-side you might be asking why I haven‚Äôt offered her my place. I did a few years ago when she was in a similar predicament, I got the OK from my partner (23 at the time) to let her stay in the living room for a few months. At the time, it was summer and she had two dogs and two cats. I explained that we didn‚Äôt have space for her pets, we have a very nervous cat (takes medicine for it). I had a convo with her about finding an apartment with enough space for dogs and how she needs to get herself right first, possibly working out something with a kennel or staying with friends. She said okay. But when my mom drove to my apartment¬† (she drove to the state and back for her) they didn‚Äôt get out of the car even though I could see them parked in the lot. Eventually, I went down to see if it really was them, was greeted by mom and sister with hugs who stepped out of the car. As the car door opened I saw her two dogs in the car. It was the one boundary that I set for my sister and communicated repeatedly. I‚Äôm not sure if I can name the emotion I felt at that moment. If I said yes, I risked my relationship with my partner, my own economic security, and likely an unsafe environment for my own pet. If I said no, I risked upsetting my sister, destroying our relationship as siblings, and generally turning into a colder person.¬†

I selfishly told her no. I had to tell her to her face that I couldn‚Äôt let the dogs stay, and she said (either there or later, and then frequently) that she‚Äôd rather be dead than give up her dogs. She stopped texting me after that, but still venmo requested me money for food (which I fulfilled the best I could, until I found out my brother was getting the same ones but to him she was asking for ‚Äúfood for the dogs.‚Äù My brother, who I have not mentioned, has his own reasons and I don‚Äôt want to misrepresent his point of view. Those were really the only interactions I had with her (her life went on, mine did too, she came to my graduation when that happened, had other problems I heard about through the grapevine).

Right now, things are not dissimilar. I am still in school, living off a grad-school stipend that is dwindling as the school year approaches. I have two cats now, and my partner and I are renting a house, or rather, my partner is (he pays for more than half the rent because grad school does not pay a lot). I have even more space, but I still can‚Äôt take the dogs. My sister has changed a lot since three years ago, and my partner has noticed. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the dogs that are influencing how he feels about allowing her to stay over, but everything that has happened since. I can‚Äôt say that I feel much differently. I‚Äôve told myself that we are trying to not enable her, but it is getting much harder to do.¬†

After the storage unit moved in, she said things are going even more downhill. She wanted to borrow my mom‚Äôs car to move her stuff from the unit. I told her mom would kill me and it‚Äôs not my car to let others borrow (my mom dropped the car off at my place so that she didn‚Äôt do anything to it). My sister told me it was the least our Mom could do for her. After another few messages she begged for it again, so that she could put her stuff in the car and live in it for a while. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, I sent her a long message saying how I felt like we had been enabling her etc. I tried to, but I just couldn‚Äôt mince my words.

My sister didn‚Äôt reply but the next day I saw her walking by on the ring doorbell. Then, the day after that my partner saw her on our street. She didn‚Äôt go up to the door, but sort of walked by, looked at my door, and continued to push a cart and her two dogs.

Yesterday, my partner and I had just gotten home from the grocery store when we heard the doorbell. Funny enough, it was the one day we decided to charge our ring doorbell. I opened the door because I thought it was my mom who lives nearby, and who I missed a call from earlier. No, it was my sister who asked if she could come in. My brain sort of short-fired, I was expecting a visit from her eventually but was still caught off guard. It didn‚Äôt feel unnatural to invite her in, and I thought maybe she had come to talk about her situation. I was stunned by her appearance that I felt myself go on auto-pilot. Her skin was so tanned and sun-burnt, her clothes smelled, and even when she was chuckling about something her eyes looked so scared. I offered her some food I was eating, and brought my fan over when she asked for one.¬†

She asked if she could charge her laptop and connect to the internet, she told me her phone got smashed (I still don‚Äôt know how). I set the internet up for her as she told me how Robby disappeared on her. She was over for only 15 minutes, mostly trying to tell me how she had been asleep for 4 days (she didn‚Äôt explain when I asked her to elaborate). I didn‚Äôt know what to do or what she planned on doing, so I made sure I had the car key in my pocket.¬†

When I put the key in my pocket I realized that my heart was sinking. That for the first time, I was scared of my sister, not just scared for her. After she had left, I honestly felt relieved, and then guilty about my relief, and then frustration towards her, and also anger at myself for having the privilege to look away and convince myself I am not responsible for her. I am not sure which emotion I feel the most.¬†

Today I missed a ring notification from her. At the time, I was in my office writing and sometimes to make myself concentrate I put my phone in the other room. It helps sometimes. When I saw the notification, I almost started crying when I saw her again. It is her birthday which I have been thinking about all day, but have no idea what message I could possibly send to her. When I opened the alert I saw her waiting at the door. I can‚Äôt even watch the full footage because I know there‚Äôs a point in the video where she realizes no one is coming to open the door. There was a point in all this, even just a few weeks ago where I thought if she found a place for the dogs we could offer her a place to crash. Now I don‚Äôt know and it makes me feel disgusted with myself, which upsets me even more for how focused I am about myself. But I am scared and don‚Äôt know how to handle this. Am I doing it all wrong? Please be nice to my sister, it is a long story and she of course did not contribute her own input to reflect her own side. I don't know how I should feel or what to do anymore.

"Feeling super anxious about going back to school‚Ä¶ did I make the wrong choice?","Hi everyone, I‚Äôm 21 (F) and could really use some honest thoughts.

Last year, I flunked out of my pre-med course. There was a lot going on‚Äîmy dad kicked my brother and me out, and between that and everything else, I just couldn‚Äôt keep up with school. I ended up getting a minimum-wage job and renting my own place, thinking I could figure things out on my own.

After a year of that, I decided to try again. My grandparents (who live 15 hours away) offered to let me live with them so I could go back to school, and I said yes. My flight is booked, I‚Äôm enrolled again in pre-med, and everything is set. But now that it‚Äôs only a month away‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm freaking out.

I‚Äôm scared. Last year, the course felt so hard. I‚Äôm terrified that I‚Äôll go back and just‚Ä¶ not get it. Like I‚Äôll fail all over again. I‚Äôm also really sad to leave. My friends, my independence, my life‚Äîeverything I know is here. I feel like I‚Äôm walking away from it all.

I‚Äôll be 22 in December, and a part of me just wants to travel and live life while I‚Äôm still young and adventurous. But then I think: I need money and education to live the life I want, right? I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. My grandparents are also super strict, so I‚Äôm nervous about that too.

"Should I go on an out-of-state mission trip or take the August SAT?","I‚Äôm stuck deciding between going on a mission trip (out-of-state, likely a great experience) or staying home to take the August SAT. I‚Äôve been studying all summer and don‚Äôt want that work to go to waste.

That said, there¬†*is*¬†a September SAT on the 13th‚Äîjust a \~3-week difference from the August 23rd test. So I technically wouldn‚Äôt be skipping the SAT entirely, just pushing it back a bit.

The dilemma:

* I‚Äôve been consistently prepping for the August SAT. I've been going to SAT classes, and I‚Äôm worried losing momentum (or trying to study while traveling) could tank my performance. Especially because I would be in the first 2 weeks of school for the September SAT so likely would have other stuff on my plate
* On the other hand, the mission trip is something I genuinely care about and would be meaningful (plus probably good extracurricular experience). I've been going for the past two years and I'm a rising junior, so I feel like going again creates consistency

Would love advice from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar boat. Is it worth delaying the SAT and risking a bit of study decay? Or should I just skip the trip and get the test done while its still fresh in my memory

1. Integrated math 2: B (both semesters)
2. AP seminar: A (both semesters - 3 on exam)
3. NGSS Biology: A first semester, B+ second  semester)

I had 7 classes the last 2 years becuase I signed up for earlier bird (0 period), but it‚Äôs not available for juniors and seniors, so I will only have 6 classes moving forward. I believe my current high school GPA is like 3.95?‚Ä¶

My junior year will look like this: 

1. AP US history
2. Chemistry P (normal chemistry not NGSS, only NGSS was an option previously)
3. AP Biology
4. AP Lang
5. Integrated Math 3
6. Symphonic band

Tomorrow is the last day of a summer French course I am doing at Diablo valley college, I‚Äôm currently at an 88% but it might jump up I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs equal to 2 years of high school study and is 5 credits.

Extra curriculars:

1. Marching band (which is required if you are in symphonic band, it sucks so bad)
2. Guitar lessons (not stellar at it, still beginning)
3. Piano lessons (from the same guy as guitar lessons, and we really only do guitar now‚Ä¶)

My goals have switched a lot, originally I wanted to be a therapist so I thought psychology but I have a new found passion for engineering, so I currently want to pursue mechanical engineering but that‚Äôs just for now at least. I know I am in no way stellar, but that‚Äôs not gonna stop me from trying. I think legacy applicant can help, I know I‚Äôd have to apply ED.

"PSA to THOSE Engineering Students: you're not the only one who has hard classes","I just had this quick interaction on TikTok, and saw this reply to my comment (I'm always online when I'm not in class, and I don't really have a lot of notifs, so I saw it immediately) and wanted to share my thoughts here.

For context, in Senior High School, I was in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Strand (it's one of the specialized 11th-12th grade programs in the Philippines for those who don't know). I found our engineering, physics, chem, and calculus subjects very hard. All this to say, I somewhat understand that superiority complex they have because as STEM students, our teachers told us the same things and we were in a similarly structured environment as engineering students. I, admittedly, also had a superiority complex as a STEM student which I've slowly gotten better from when I made friends and connected with people outside of STEM and now that I'm in college.

Anyway, now I'm an accountancy student.

At least for me, both engineering and accounting topics are quite difficult in different aspects (i might just be dumb and lazy when it comes to studying tho). I'm somewhat proficient in using formulas which is good for some aspects of STEM subjects, as well as long problem solving, which is good for some accounting activities. Both are very hard for me still, all things considered.

Some of my closest high school friends who are in engineering courses now, I've been fine with and I've never heard/seen them act like they're superior towards other courses that are not STEM-aligned because we're all mutually suffering in college regardless of our course. 

But there are apparently some engineering students that have some sort of superiority complex and think they're better than everyone just because of what they study?

Like, I'm sorry you're suffering in your course, but I'm suffering in mine too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"story time","My best friend has always been the perfect one‚Äîsomeone who was against online friends and quite introverted. Let‚Äôs call her *Cupcake*.

After our 10th board exams, Cupcake was going through the comment section of her favorite influencer when she came across a comment from a guy she really liked. Let‚Äôs call him *Marshmallow*. She followed him right away.

Marshmallow didn‚Äôt accept her request on the first day, but on the second day, he did‚Äîand he was the one who started the conversation. Cupcake was really excited that a guy had texted her first, so without thinking much, she replied. Slowly, their conversation grew. Marshmallow was from a different state and a year younger than her. They started talking all day long, and after 5 PM, they would talk again at 9:30 every night.

Cupcake started getting attached, especially because she was talking to a guy for the first time. Marshmallow had recently gotten out of a relationship, so their vibes really matched.

One day, while Cupcake was telling him about some incidents from her life, Marshmallow suddenly said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to her. That phrase slowly became common between them, and they started calling each other by sweet nicknames. Cupcake fell in love with Marshmallow‚Äîand he said he loved her too. Although they never officially dated due to the distance, Cupcake was madly in love with him.

Then one day, Marshmallow told Cupcake that he liked another girl. After saying all that, he still ended the conversation with ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù which was really not okay. Cupcake cried a lot that day‚Äîit made my blood boil, but I couldn‚Äôt do anything.

A month or two later, Marshmallow told Cupcake that they should stop doing the things they used to do because he cared for her and knew she loved him. He felt it would be best to create some distance. But every time Marshmallow tried to act mature and pull away, Cupcake would try to bring things back to how they used to be because she was scared of losing him. And each time, they‚Äôd end up going back to their lovey-dovey dynamic.

What Cupcake doesn‚Äôt realize is that Marshmallow knows his priorities. Deep down, he knows that nothing serious can happen between them. But Cupcake isn‚Äôt ready to believe that. She still hopes that someday, everything will fall into place.

So, do you think Marshmallow actually loves her? Or should I try once again to help Cupcake understand the reality of the situation?

(Also, the guy is genuinely very sweet and takes really good care of Cupcake.)","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1m7uhmm/story_time/","1753330062.0","highschool","LaalPariiii"

"UGH!!! My high school-self fucked me over with one email account!","Okay, Okay... not as dramatic as it looks, but..

(if you want a sappy recollection of my past mistakes, if not just skip below)
Well, when I was younger I very much did not care about my online security, I mean I nothing crazy happened to me, I never got scared or got trucked into meeting a creep. I was actully quite home bodied as a teen.
But now in my growing adulthood, I know now how easy it is to steal information, and now I am worried about how much of my self is out their.
And... I vividly remember using my old email carelessly... like full name... I used my freaking name online. I was carful, making sure to never out my self as a minor, have minimal info and ask my parents for help.
But I just know their are a dozen or so websites that have my information. I nolonger use that account anymore, but still have it in the background, and it kills me everything I see it and how much I just didn't care about my online security.

(So now onto my real question)
Does anyone know how to check your history for sites you have previously signed in with a Google email account. like checking out everything you have ever signed into on Google. I know they have their password manager but that is not what I am looking for. I plan on eliminating my old childhood account, scrubbing the data and tracking down any info that might be important so I can switch search browsers with as much of a paper trail removed.

And I've just drawn the conclusion that it's way too many possibilities for me to risk it, and l actually find it quite selfish that people are having hella children during this time of such uncertainty, especially the ones who have kids bos of ""legacy"" reasons like the avg person even has a legacy to begin with ... & genuinely don't understand why society pushes having children on women and young girls so much, why not shift that to them prioritizing their career and things that would allow their potential kids to have a good life LATER on in life.

I hardly attended 1st semester and in the start of January I had to have a surgery for pilonidal sinus and then again in may for laser surgery because it relapsed. Throughout this time college made my life liv√≠ng hell. They were inhumane and so inconsiderate..

I am currently taking a drop and wanted to join a college next year but to be honest I never really wanted to join college ever since class 10th I didn't.
The sole reason I joined that college was FOMO and a hope that I might end up making friends (I never had any friends throughout my life). My school life was soo bad that I don't feel any nostalgia and stuff..
My family has been really supportive of my decision. Infact my mother keeps saying to pursue a degree from open or a college where I just have to give exams so I can pursue any skills and multiple hobbies I have. I am really into learning different fields and subject since childhood (Polymath) and I love learning new language (Polyglot).
After my recent experience with health setback,I wish to start running and swimming too.

I am really grateful for my mother and how supportive she is but I get scared.
I have ADHD so it's hard for me to be consistent and stuff and I am afraid that I will end up not having any social life.
I know my mother is right that I am given a choice to not be in rat race and actually pursue different fields and different skills instead of sitting in college from 9 to 5(which my ADHD brains hate so much).

I am positive that after few courses and living here and there throughout the 3 years while I side by side pursue college degree will be good for me..

But i am slightly unsure. I have been bedrotting from past 7 month's and have huge scrolling addiction since 4 years I guess 
I would really love some advice as I am really stuck and depressed..","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m84y6h/need_some_advice/","1753365000.0","college","Traditional-Worth193"

"How ""good"" do you have to be to pursue STEM?","I'm a rising Junior rn and I'm thinking of what to major in 
Throughout HS and Middle School I genuinely thought I was going to be pursuing STEM all the way through - but rn I'm having self-doubts

My stronger points are English, History, and stuff in that area (hypocritical ik) but I get burnt out easily and I'm more inclined to doing STEM work when I get older

Between Math and Science, my science is definitely better and I like doing more lab work than doing math - amongst my grades, my lowest is math

Can I still genuinely have a chance at STEM if I work on my math before applying or am I done for? I know I'm definitely not for something like Engineering with my current level right now but do I still have a chance? 

Also how's college life doing STEM or other majors?

"It's time to move and find land -- but how?","I'm 27F, USA, have lived with my parents again for the past few years and ready to take the next step to move and gain my independence. I honestly have just began gaining credit, I have a very small savings nest, and I'm an artist finally getting out there. I have thought about going back to school but currently unsure where I would want to finish my degree (maybe I could live on campus but that isn't my desire). 

My history with renting: I have only moved in with my ex boyfriend -- and he took most of the responsibility and didn't really explain to me what was going on. I can't really afford anywhere where I live in the city like most Americans. I cannot do a roommate situation as I have no local friends and every roommate attempt ended in absolute chaos and prolonging my stay at home. 

I want to do this myself but I don't know the steps to find... maybe like a small plot of land that I could maybe put a trailer on or just tiny living! I don't need much space, I would just like a yard good enough for homesteading. I love the idea of being in a rural place, I have no problems with living alone, and I know how to protect myself.

I originally plan on applying for Spring 2026, but I am delaying for Fall 2026. I have not given grace for myself at all. Ever since I graduated from high school, I constantly go to school. I graduate with my associate of science, transferred to a university, and later dropped out to transfer back to a community college. 

I am eligible for tuition assistance from the program, but I may be off of the list because I haven‚Äôt enrolled in any classes (because I couldn‚Äôt due to already completing all of my pre-requisites and unqualified for FAFSA due to many credit hours).

I still want to be a nurse, at the end of the day, but I am unable to support myself if I go through this. I will be unable to pay off debt, rent, and etc. I am a first-generation and I only had myself to rely on.

Family starts expecting return on investment, you start overthinking what your future will look like, you start thinking ""oh I am getting old, by now I should have been a millionaire as planned 10 years ago"" üòÇ.

I had dreams growing up (I am 20), you know and I did everything ""right"". I studied well in school, got into a great college, am studying my butt off- and I know no one is entitled to anything. However, even doing everything by the book has cooked us. 

The one dream I had (being a soccer player) has passed me up and all I see now is a life of corporate slavery, chained to a 9 to 5 if there even will be a job (!). I am actively losing it every single day, get home and all I can do is sleep. 

AI is going to take over every job, and even if it doesn't take my job, society is cooked and therefore I am cooked. The rich want us to die off, inequality is higher than ever, climate change (WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT CLIMATE CHNAGE), water/food shortages, dumb-brained politics. 

I really don't see a world where things work out. And yes every generation had their ""thing"", the difference here is that so many ""things"" have to be resolved and go right and that's not gonna happen.

I wanted a life where I'd get a nice big home, retire my immigrant parents, have kids. But who in their right mind would have kids just for them to be cooked. 

I have began resenting my own parents for choosing to have me, which I know is unfair. 

I know complaining doesn't do anything, but it's tough out there as all of you know. I have completely given up hope and dropped the ball on life, no drive, aspirations, meaning, just living day by day until it all collapses.

"Taking a Semester Off‚Ä¶","Taking a Semester Off

Hey all.

I‚Äôve recently come face-to-face with the very likely fact that I may need to take a semester off to work and save myself financially and emotionally from ‚Äúadulting.‚Äù

‚ÄîContext‚Äî

I (25 now) am something of an unwilling super-senior who, by merit of having a severe seizure disorder in my early 20‚Äôs, had his college plans delayed for nearly 4 years (I did online courses off and on until we found a solution to my health).

Not only did this set me back from all of my friends whom I graduated high school with, it also set me back financially. And even though I have been seizure free for two years I am still clawing my way out of the financial struggles that came with my ‚Äúseizure arc.‚Äù The biggest of which has been affording college on my own, and struggling to save enough left over to secure a vehicle, among other things. I am largely financially independent.

‚ÄîExtra Stuff‚Äî

In any case after being denied student loan options from every major lender in my state, I‚Äôm finding myself at a loss regarding how I‚Äôll manage to afford the fall semester.

I have a feeling that even if I do manage to find a lender or scrounge enough money to make the fall semester happen, I‚Äôll be psychologically crushed and still without transportation. I can‚Äôt afford to lose more time but, more than that I can‚Äôt afford to jeopardize my grades because I intend to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree and do medical research.

‚Äî‚ÄîClosing Questions‚Äî‚Äî

In any case, I apologize for the word wall of context- I just needed to write this all out. My ultimate point with all of this was to perhaps spark discussion and ask you all for any advice, suggestions, or just personal experiences with navigating a delayed college experience due to unforeseen circumstances, or if you‚Äôve taken a semester or two off.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m8khqp/taking_a_semester_off/","1753401850.0","college","Azuri-Os"
"Career Path Concerns","Hi,

I‚Äôm currently considering switching my college major and minor‚Äîfrom majoring in Elementary Education with double minors in Music and African American Studies to majoring in Psychology with a minor in Education. I‚Äôve always wanted to become an elementary school teacher, whether as a general education teacher or a music teacher. However, lately, I‚Äôve been second-guessing this path because I‚Äôm worried about the pay.

I truly see myself teaching and working with young children‚Äîit‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about. I also love music, which is why I chose to minor in it. I added African American Studies because I genuinely enjoy learning about Black history, culture, and contributions. But even with all that passion, I can‚Äôt ignore the concern about financial stability. That‚Äôs what led me to start researching alternative career paths, particularly becoming a Child Psychologist.

As I looked into it more, I realized that working with children in a psychological and emotional support role also aligns with my interests. It still allows me to make a difference in their lives, just in a different setting. I‚Äôm reaching out for insight‚Äîbased on what I‚Äôve shared, do you think switching to Psychology might be a better fit long-term, or is there a way to balance my passion for teaching with financial security?

I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts.

I will never forget that moment. It wasn‚Äôt just about the music. It was about love, faith, family, and being seen‚Äîtruly seen‚Äîby the person I admire most. Since that day, I have never stopped playing the keyboard. Every time I play, especially in church, I see my father watching me from the pews, smiling with pride. And every time, I remember that night.

My father taught me more than how to play music. He taught me patience, dedication, and what it means to believe in someone. I had shown interest in learning, and he was committed to helping me succeed‚Äînot just for my sake, but because he wanted us to play together. In just two weeks, I was already playing fluently. Around that same time, we found out that the church‚Äôs keyboard player had left. During the next service, the pastor said she had been praying for a replacement. My father turned to me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to train you even more so you can help.‚Äù But in the very next service, I was already on stage, playing with the worship team.

I was nervous, but I felt ready‚Äînot only because I had practiced, but because someone believed in me. That faith, that love, and that encouragement shaped me. From that day on, music became a part of my identity and my way of serving others. My father‚Äôs pride and trust gave me confidence that I still carry into every challenge I face.

Beyond music, my father has always inspired me to study and grow. He encouraged me to learn English, and he is the reason I dream of studying abroad and becoming a doctor. He never pushed me with pressure, only with belief.

That Christmas Eve changed my faith and my idea of family. Since then, we‚Äôve been more active in church, and our home has become a place of more intentional connection and communion. ‚ÄúNingu√©m Explica Deus‚Äù became our song, and even now, every time we hear or play it together, we both feel that same emotion all over again. Sometimes we still cry, but it‚Äôs always tears of gratitude.

I am grateful for many things in my life, but this moment‚Äîthis memory‚Äîis a piece of who I am. It taught me what it means to love, to be loved, and to carry that love through action, music, faith, and purpose.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m8m52h/can_you_help_me_review_my_common_app_essay/","1753406541.0","ApplyingToCollege","Technical_Draft_3799"
"Really stressed about my new job and I cant tell anyone about it","I live in a city where everyone works for the same hospital, including all of my friends. I have a really cool job starting in September and I'm really stressed about it. My new position is as a field service engineer, it's fully remote/travel only within my state, about a 30% raise, salary, and im so excited and stress but I have to pretend it doesn't exist. I cant put in my notice until late August because of a sign on bonus I accepted last year, and im working a job that I don't really like and I have to talk like I'm planning on being here for years.

It's a really good move and it's going to allow me to move to a bigger city where I'll be happier. I extended my lease for only 3 months since I didn't know if I'd get the job or not, so I have enough time to move. I'll be getting roommates with a few other people who travel for work so I'll be renting a really nice house for pretty cheap. 

It's a really good situation and im so happy and excited, but I have to internalize all of it. I can't even tell my family since they know my boss and have a lot of friends at the company. It's mentally exhausting. 

It also sucks since I work with 2 other people right now on evening 12s. 1 of them is retiring and the other is transferring departments. Everyone thinks I'm going to be the only person there and theyre preparing for me to work solo since the new hires have to train on day shift until theyre competent. I can't say anything for another month. I feel bad for my coworkers but it's not worth the risk of getting fired early is my boss finds out and having to repay the bonus. I can't move back my start date either.

And im stressed about the culture of my new job. 100% remote sounds cool but now it's really setting in that I'll never actually meet any of my coworkers or bosses, unless we're at a conference together. I'll be travelling on 1 week notice all over the place, driving a ton, and my primary training is in Europe, Massachusetts, and California. It's going to be such a huge change and I just can't risk my support network knowing about it yet.

"On Target Schools and the Job Market:","This was a reply to someone talking about how the modern college degree means nothing. I thought I would post it here to hear your collective thoughts.

>Let me correct you for a second here. College degrees from¬†*non-target state universities*¬†are worth nothing right now. If you go to an elite T25 American university, you are essentially isolated from the bad job-market. A company would rather hire someone with a 2.3 GPA who got shitfaced every weekend and on academic probation at a target school than to hire someone who busted their ass off in a local flagship university with internships and relevant experience.

>""Target schools"" are a cheap heuristic to determine someone's worth by hiring departments of large companies who have to review thousands of applications for each job posting. This is a very flawed shortcut because in terms of raw effort, target schools tend to me more grade¬†*inflated*¬†compared to the average college. So, on average, someone who has to go to a prestigious university actually can do better in their classes with less effort. This plus extremely small class sizes, and an endowment that is typically tenfold bigger than the average college, you get students who have to barely lift a finger to get any sort of job.

>In a more systemic lens, we can look at PMC jobs are a transfer of a parent's social class from one generation to another. They have always been superfluous by nature. With the advent of economic downturn, AI, and the fact that desk-jobs can't linearly grow with population, means that less of these jobs are available relative to the population. These jobs become infinitely more competitive, and a problem that was before a mild annoyance becomes completely debilitating for anyone trying to find a job.

>Naturally, to protect their own class interests, those at T25 universities (typically those in the upper class of petit-bourgeois or sons of capital owners), give those jobs away to those in their alumni network or within their respected caste/social circle. PMC jobs will always exist, but they will only exist to serve our upper class as the circular justification for their own position.

>Admission to these colleges are typically indirectly class indicators as well, I hope I don't have to browbeat you about this fact since it's been drilled into our minds already through so many¬†*Atlantic*¬†and¬†*NYT*¬†articles with that same thesis.

>For examples for where the job market will go, look at the white-collar job markets in places like tier 1-2 city China or South Korea.

"Is UC Merced on the same level as UMass Amherst?","I know UC Merced gets a lot of shit from here for being the least prestigious UC, (atleast, until UC Bakersfield becomes a thing,) but I‚Äôve been interested in it. I‚Äôd describe myself as an above average student, 3.7 GPA, full IB, but I also want to try and get through undergrad as debt-free as possible. As an Oregon resident, I have access to the WUE program which would massively reduce the cost of going to UCM, the only UC on that list.

I‚Äôm trying to find a good balance of prestige and cost, as me and my family can‚Äôt afford schools like UW or UMich without a huge scholarship. I‚Äôve fallen in love with WSU‚Äôs campus, which seems to have some prestige and an attainable cost of attendance, which also would have a good path into UW for grad school (hopefully.)

Higher than the former ‚Äúworst‚Äù UC‚ÄîRiverside, higher than my state‚Äôs flagship, UO. I‚Äôm looking to go into a medical field, probably studying biology, so some prestige in a school does matter to me.

"this is absolutely ridiculous and i need help/advice","So I attend an HBCU and happen to be majoring in Electrical Engineering. I managed to fail three classes in Fall24 for Physics lab and lecture and calculus 2 after previously never failing a class in life - and to be frank - i dont want to hear anything unless you‚Äôve been in a stem major or something similar.

Anyway, i retook physics and got an A in both classes because I got professors that actually felt like doing their job. I haven‚Äôt been able to register for Calculus 2 until this summer , because my uni denied me permission to take a calc class at an online accredited university and I couldnt get into ones at any close community colleges. (and even if i did im certain theynwould deny me)

They dropped me from the calculus class due to nonpayment, I was unaware I didnt have another loan to cover the balance. i am unfamiliar with how loans work, and i quickly got approved for a loan that would cover the balance that they told me was ‚Äú6064 USD‚Äù (my loan was 6100). They approved my loan at my uni, but they did not get back to me about my class being reinstated.

They now are actually saying I wasnt dropped due to administrative action and I dropped it voluntarily before i attended the class/started it which is absolute horseshit. This summer class was asynchronous and had no zoom meetings. They also said I still have a balance of 400 or so USD. (They said after the class is dropped I wont see what I actually owe and I have to ask them directly so I have no way of knowing my real ‚Äúbalance‚Äù)

I‚Äôm frankly enraged. Is there a way I can cancel the loan I put out with my parents to cover what I owed for the summer?

Also are there any community colleges or universities in Maryland, New York, or in between that offer my major without absolutely robbing me? I‚Äôm strongly considering withdrawing from my university if that is at all possible because I‚Äôm spending way too much money for these people to send interns to have me jump through hoops like a circus monkey. i just don‚Äôt want to be broke forever.

"Theres so many events and very little support","Hi, I'm a graduating student in highschool and also our school's student body president. Being president of the student body has always been something that I wanted to do. And I knew even back then that the title had many responsibilities and things that they needed to do. But I'm just so stressed kasi almost every month may event, and I have little support from the school. Me and my members (well, 3 or 4 of them atleast) have been using our money to fund the designs and whatnot, that we do for an event. And I've been trying to fix this, since we're using our money that we should be using for our snacks or money that we'vesaved for ourselves. I've recommended US running a fundraiser in school (since they don't really allow us to do school activities outside since it's dangerous) and even doing a solicitation on parents or gpta officers. But they didn't agree. And I could somehow understand why because no.1 they said running a fundraiser would slow down the sales they get from their cafeteria tat they use to feed teachers (since our fundraiser was selling snacks, like homemade snacks that I made every night), and no.2 parents just had a recent project for the school classrooms, etc. BUT I would've understood if expectations weren't so damn high, they said it had to be ""simple"" and ""fire"".... we can't do that with almost no money. And they did say that we should just ask them and the other students for materials, but students haven't given us anything even after we put up lists of what we needed, and they are very hard to ask for things since they're either stingy, in a bad mood (and when they're in a bad mood, everything is just wrong for them one way or another), or they're busy. And if your lucky to catch them in a good mood, then that's good. But its so hard that way, and its lowkey very unprofessional. So now I'm stressed because now I'm broke, there's so many events left, there's an event next month AGAIN, designs for nutrition month still isn't finished with the lack of materials, and I'm a graduating student who hasn't prioritized their studies yet.

"Adulting - A Perspective","Look. It doesn't matter if times were easier 20 years ago, it doesn't help you to yearn for it. All you have is right now and an indeterminate future.

What can you do - my ten thoughts.

1. Invest prudently in yourself. No need to go $100k in debt for college or post grad (unless you're going to be an MD). Choose a degree that will be useful and, if you can, avoid disciplines that AI will take over. Also, there are many courses that will help progress your career, it doesn't have to be a degree.

2. Try to live within your means. I know it's hard but, sit down with a spreadsheet and net your incomings and outgoings. The surplus can be saved but, don't forget to have some life too. Tomorrow isn't promised. And when you're in the old people's home, the memories you make as a young person will make being old bearable. If you don't have a surplus, figure out how to reduce your outgoings and increase your incomings. Easier said than done, I know!

3. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Know who your allies are who will help. Cultivate those relationships with offers of support, help and kindness are a two way street.

4. Marriage is hard sometimes. Unless you're married to a jerk, remember, most arguments come from a place of good intent.

5. Kids are on loan to you. Treasure your time with them. Spend as much time with them as you possibly can do that when they're older, the parental relationship becomes a friendship. Don't be afraid to say no though!

6. There are words of power. Use them wisely.
Yes - the opening of possibilities.
No - the setting of boundaries.
Home - sanctuary and identity.
Love - (obviously).
These are the four I know. There will be others that matter to you.

7. Be as quick as you can to forgive. Life is too short to hold a grudge. Yes some things are unforgivable but, who used the last of the milk isn't it. Especially people you love.

8. Don't expect life to be amazing all the time but be open for noticing things that offer joy. My most recent was, every light on my way to work was green!

9. Treasure your time. If someone or something is taking more of your time than you want to give, manage it. My work is important to me, I enjoy it but, I don't have anything installed on my phone and I don't bring my laptop home or away on holiday.

10. You matter. Your health matters. Make time to do those health appointments ( obvs without going bankrupt!) especially preventative care. Don't put it off, something trivial may become something non trivial.

I'm scared to drive, so i don't (even though I have my license).

I feel horribly unattractive so I don't date. I don't even try. I mean I can't do online dating because I'm under 6ft and 98% of women filter 6ft> men out immediately. And I don't meet anyone in person or if I do, they're never attracted to me as a person. It is what it is. I haven't had a serious girlfriend since I was 18. I am miserable.

I'm scared to death of rejection even though most of my life has been nothing but a long series of it in all areas. I can barely learn new skills due to ADHD so it's not like if I work hard I'll achieve things. 

I am stuck. I am a child, living the same day over and over.  Nothing about me is respectable and I do not have a shred of respect for myself. I live as if I hate myself.

I had to turn down going to my nieces birthday party out of town this weekend because my only way back is a ride from my mother who likes to drink and drive.  I hate living like this.  I hate not being a real human adult. It sucks but I have no idea how to change or be better.

This process started all the way in the fall months of 2024. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this and didn‚Äôt find out till about a month ish ago. So now I have to commute but the problem is, my mom is the only one with a car. We‚Äôve sorta figured out a plan and it looks all good on paper but I just think it would be more beneficial for me to get a car which my mom disagrees with. She hasn‚Äôt really given me specific reasons just always says that I can just wait till income tax season and she‚Äôll help me and that we have it all figured out already so focus on school. Which I understand but after looking at the way things will play out‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.

First, I‚Äôll have to pay for my part of the insurance which is gonna be about 160. I also have my phone bill which is 76 ish, and gas which isn‚Äôt that bad, her car doesn‚Äôt take more than 20. But I don‚Äôt have a job and even if I get a job, I‚Äôd only be able to work Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays. 

Second, my siblings are also gonna be in school, my school is a 20 minute drive and when my classes start is around the time my siblings get outta school which means as soon as my mom gets off work she‚Äôll have to take me to school early so I may get to class on time.

Third, I know many people don‚Äôt but I‚Äôm almost 20 and there are kids younger than me that have a car. I feel like I‚Äôm falling behind. I see so many benefits behind getting a car but my mom is making me doubt myself extremely. 

I have some money saved up but I‚Äôm waiting to see how much my refund from school will be to help secure a bigger price range so I can actually get a good working car.

"I hate self improvement","I hate the idea of ""improving yourself"" so that you could be worthy of love, of keeping your job, etc. I just want to exist with freedom and minimal stress. This constant rat race makes life not worth living imo. Do monkeys have any desire to improve themselves? No, they want to eat fruit. Self improvement is to me an oppressive idea.

Self improvement for the sake of self improvement is stupid. You are already good enough. You should self improve because it makes you feel good, or improves your life in some way.

What I want, and what I suspect what everyone else wants, is to be loved. Is to be enough. Having to work hard to reach that seems like a grueling marathon.

"(Career Advice Needed) Torn Between Purpose and Income: Holistic Healing, Somatics, and Supporting a Family?","Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm reaching out because I could¬†*really*¬†use some career advice - I‚Äôm in a moment of major (but healthy) career anxiety, and I want to ask for guidance from real people.

I know Reddit can be a little ruthless, and that's okay - I‚Äôm open to tough love, but I‚Äôm mostly looking for sincere, thoughtful, and pragmatic advice from anyone who's been here or knows this path.

**The situation:**

I'm a 26 year old male, living in China right now teaching English. I graduated from an interdisciplinary college where I created my own major:¬†**‚ÄúHolistic Approaches to Healing: Body-Mind-Spirit Integration.‚Äù**¬†Most of my coursework centered around somatic psychology, embodiment, movement, health, and healing.

I‚Äôm passionate about holistic health, somatics, fitness, yoga, nutrition, meditation, ayahuasca/psychedelic work (in moderation), and deep psychological, spiritual, and physical healing. I‚Äôve apprenticed at a Chinese medicine clinic. I was a personal trainer for a year and¬†*loved it*. But like many in the healing arts, I‚Äôm now stuck between what feeds my soul and what will support a future family.

**Why the urgency?**

I recently got engaged to a woman I love deeply. She‚Äôs a med student who‚Äôll graduate in two years. She‚Äôll be an MD, and while I‚Äôm incredibly proud of her, I‚Äôm equally committed to never being financially dependent on her. I want to fully¬†*share the*¬†load of providing, especially if she takes maternity leave or steps back at any point.

Up until now, I‚Äôve been content living modestly as a bachelor with onestly very little responsibilities besides my own finances, health, and saving enough money to travel around. I've worked in restaurants, odd jobs, supplement/health shops and in fitness. But it‚Äôs time for me to choose a career that can realistically support a future: a home, kids, travel, freedom, and security. My minimum goal income is¬†**$120K+**, ideally¬†**up to $200K+ over time**.

**What I‚Äôm drawn to:**

I‚Äôm looking for a path that combines¬†**science + spirit**,¬†**healing + embodiment**, and¬†**financial security + soul purpose**. I want to help people¬†*truly heal*¬†‚Äî emotionally, spiritually, physically ‚Äî at the root cause level. I don‚Äôt believe Western medicine alone is equipped for that (though I respect and admire it).

Some career options I‚Äôm exploring:

**Nurse Practitioner (NP) with a Functional/Integrative Medicine focus**

**Pros:**¬†Offers licensure, strong income potential, broad scope of practice, and the flexibility to eventually open my own clinic.

**Cons:**¬†While it checks the practical boxes, something about it feels a bit out of sync with my core values. I worry that, given my holistic background, I‚Äôll feel out of place in the conventional, rigid clinical model of Western medicine. That said, I wonder if this could be a necessary crucible ‚Äî a rite of passage ‚Äî to gain the credentials and legitimacy needed to later practice in the more integrative, soul-aligned way I envision.

**Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT)**

Pros: Recognized title, stable job

Cons: Debt-to-income ratio, may feel too ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and not holistic enough

**Doctor of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (DAOM)**

Pros: Loved apprenticing in acupuncture, deeply holistic, rich tradition

Cons: Unsure about income potential, especially starting out,

**Somatic Psychotherapist / Jungian-Informed Therapist**

Pros: Feels¬†*most aligned*¬†with my heart and calling

Cons: Licensing route unclear, long journey, possibly lower income

**Hybrid Holistic Practitioner**¬†(e.g. Integrative NP + Somatic Therapy + Psychedelic Guide + Fitness/Nutrition)

Is this even¬†*realistic*¬†to combine into a legit practice?

**What I need help with:**

* Are any of these careers viable for earning $120‚Äì200K while staying deeply true to my mission?
* Has anyone successfully combined spirituality, psychology, fitness, and medicine into a¬†*real*¬†and¬†*profitable*¬†practice? Think like Huberman meets, Gabor mate, meets shipibo healer. Idk...
* Which paths offer¬†**licensure, respect, impact, and income**¬†\- especially if you want to work independently?
* Am I overthinking the income part or underestimating the market for what I love?

**What‚Äôs driving this:**

This isn‚Äôt just about ego or matching my spouse‚Äôs income - it‚Äôs about wanting to build a life with someone I love, and not have to choose between passion and provision. I‚Äôm scared that if I follow my heart, I‚Äôll never make enough money. And if I chase money, I‚Äôll lose my soul.

I‚Äôm tired of trying to figure this out with AI or therapy alone. I‚Äôm ready to get real, take action, and commit - but I need your help to make a smart, aligned, and financially solid decision.

Thank you in advance for reading. Seriously. I welcome any advice, honest reflections, reality checks, or questions.

**Summary:**¬†26M passionate about holistic healing, somatics, fitness, and spirituality. Want to choose a career that‚Äôs both deeply purposeful and can earn $120K+ to support a family alongside my future MD spouse. Torn between NP, DAOM, DPT, somatic psychotherapy, (another career I'm not aware of?), or creating a hybrid role. Looking for real guidance, tough love, or anything in between.

"FRUSTRATED W/ PNB | REMITTANCE FUND ON-HOLD | POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ü§¨","
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm hoping someone here can share insights or advice about an issue I‚Äôm facing with PNB (Philippine National Bank).

My father sent me money via Western Union, and I successfully claimed it into my PNB debit account. I was even able to withdraw part of the amount at the ATM. Then suddenly, I noticed that my account balance became negative ‚Äî which really stressed me out.

When I asked, I was told the reason was an ‚Äúerroneous transfer‚Äù tied to the remittance. They said the funds were placed on hold or reversed. I was asked to deposit back what I withdrew, which I already did to settle it.

I also received a message from PNB saying there was a debit transaction processed over-the-counter at their Overseas Remittance Department. The staff assisting me told me they had already emailed the head office so the funds could be transferred properly ‚Äî but I‚Äôm still waiting.

To make things worse, I‚Äôve been passed around between my account‚Äôs branch, the main branch, and customer service, and none of them have provided a clear answer or real help. It‚Äôs exhausting and frustrating. I feel like no one wants to take ownership of the issue.

I just want my account to be back to normal and to stop dealing with all this stress and confusion.

Has anyone gone through the same thing?
How long does it take for PNB to fix something like this?
And is there a more effective way to escalate this issue?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any help or support would mean a lot. üôè","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m8tx27/frustrated_w_pnb_remittance_fund_onhold_poor/","1753432808.0","Adulting","terixxz"
"Practicality vs desire","I‚Äôve reached the point at which I must decide where I want to focus my application efforts. My end goal is to be accepted into medical school, and though I‚Äôm not sure I have what it takes to get there I am very motivated to try. 

I am a Texas resident, dad makes a lot of money (500k+) and is willing to support me through college and medical school. I do not want to burden him so heavily during my undergrad years that paying for medical school becomes a struggle. 

If I went to UT Austin, which I am very likely to be accepted by, I would pay significantly less than any other college I‚Äôm considering. Plus, it seems to be the highest ranked college I‚Äôm capable of getting into. 

However, I hate Texas. I have lived here for my entire life and I think it fucking sucks. There are good parts and Austin is a fine city, but I am generally depressed by my surroundings. I want to leave. I‚Äôd be willing to go back to Texas for medical school.

Ideally, I would go somewhere in the northwest or Colorado. Thinking UW, Oregon state, UC Boulder

Those colleges are much pricier than UT Austin, though. A difference of maybe 50k just so that I can have my scenic mountain backdrop and pretty trees. I feel as though it would be shitty and selfish of me to ask my father to pay so much more for something that is entirely unnecessary.

The question then is this: would I be better off sucking it up and staying in Texas (financially better, close to home, better school rank), or going PNW/Colorado (prettier, preferable climate, enjoyable outdoors, abortions are legal, expensive)?

And, bonus question: Is it a good idea to get residency elsewhere before beginning medical school applications or should I remain a Texas resident for those? 

Thank you in advance and if there‚Äôs anyone who‚Äôs had a similar dilemma please lmk what you did, neither of my parents went to college and I do not have a lot in the way of role models.

"Feeling Trapped","VERY LONG POST; Im a Filipino Student hoping for a good education abroad, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Philippine education is okay, but it honestly could be better. It‚Äôs also because I want to restart my life over. I see TikTok and Facebook post of Filipino students getting to school abroad with scholarships, and even one of my closest friends during Grade 7 got into USA. Not going to lie, I felt a pinch in my heart. I keep thinking about, ‚ÄúIt should have been me.‚Äù Over and over again. I also can‚Äôt help but cry. 

Im in a school where it‚Äôs average, but not really great. I have high grades, Im also fearless in leadership, but I can‚Äôt help feel like I should have done more, I feel like I should have been in a place where what I do matters. In the school Im in, our principal fakes a smile, and pretends she does something to the school, but in reality she doesn‚Äôt. All the chairs aren‚Äôt even nice here, broken wooden chairs, and sometimes cutting risks because the metal nail is visible on top of the table. And this schools, only favors Specials, we have so called ‚ÄòSpecial Program in the Arts,‚Äô ‚ÄòSpecial program in Technology and Engineering‚Äô but in reality, they get so burnt out. The schedule for Special‚Äôs is 6:30 AM to 4pm. Insane. I ask myself, ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt they provide better chairs, better tables, better rooms, and better education if they expect us to do better?‚Äô I was one of the programs, but I left because I could barely sleep, eat, and so many lectures, assignments, for what!? And they can‚Äôt even give a reasonable deadline!?

I also can‚Äôt help but be saddened by the situation of the Philippines today, the politicians are so money hungry. The people who are struggling to make ends meet still paying taxes not knowing that they are feeding pigs who want more money. The people who are trying to get food still paying taxes to those pigs that eats expensive shit on their plate.

And I‚Äôm affected, Im one of those people whoa re affected, aware, but also trapped.

I really wanna go abroad and study there, but I also have to consider tuition fees, overall expenses. But how? My parents are 100k in debt, because of my dumb father who got scammed. Fuck. And I feel bad for my mother who is trying to feed us all, and I can‚Äôt help but cry. I feel so trapped. I feel like Im in jail. What did I do wrong?

It reminds me of the day I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be born. Just why? Is my life just a mistake? All I wish is for a good education without the pressure of fees. All I wish is for a scholarship and a good education‚Ä¶

"As a russian gen z gamer, I'm annoyed with millenials","Despite living in Uzbekistand for entire of life. But I spend much on DTF, a famous Russian gaming forum where people are discussing about pop culture news. And, sadly, it's full of annoying millenials who are too nostalgic for early 2000s PC gaming. You know, Gothic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Baldur's Gate and etc. These millenials really hate zoomers because, oh my god, we play much different games. Like Zelda, Genshin Impact and Minecraft. According to them, we are ""shit-eaters"" because we are not playing ""right games"". What's funny, many russian zoomers enjoy old Nintendo game slike Earthbound and Super Mario 64, even if they never played them in childhood. They know what is emulator. Russian millenials, in contrast, don't play these ""hipster shit"" and prefer to restrict themselves with a small amount of videogames they played in teenagehood. Oh my god... Even gen z russians are not going into too much to nostalgia like russian millenials. Gen z russian gamer are not obsessed with FNAF like Gen Y obsessed with Heroes of Might and Magic III. 

(Sigh) Sometimes, I really think that Russian millenials are truly the Lost Generation. Why? Because they survived 90s crisis at young age. I remember how I talked with Venezuelians and they are extremely rude in talking. Poverty, high criminality and other hopeless shit which where 90s in Russia really hurted mental health of many russians. Russia zoomers raised in more comfortable conditions and much well educated.

"Questions: Financial Support & Deciding Degree route","I want to start with, I am a 28 year old married mom who had attempted community college when I graduated high-school, got screwed over my financial aide by the end of the first semester due to lack of guidance with financial aide, and lack of communication on the school's end. Since then, I have been too afraid to pursue a degree. Now, I am looking to find a better paying job in a field I am interested in.

Financial Assistance:

Would I be eligible at all for any financial aide/assistance at my age if I decided to get a degree online? If so, what would be available to me?

Degree Decision:

I am torn between a couple of fields. 1) I initially tried getting a degree in Education to become a teacher and still long for it but do not think in this day in age it would be wise, nor am I confident in my abilities to teach. 2) I have expressed a huge interest in Computer Science for the sole idea of stable hours (9-5 kind of job), general lack of face to face communication, but mainly the salary and career possibilities. My concerns would be that it is over saturated and not a lot of open positions in IT. 3) Child/Family Therapy. I feel more connected to this due to growing up around mental health disorders within my siblings and going to therapy with them, some tragedy behind mental health within my family, and now facing mental disorders in my own son. My only concerns are the pay, and the hours along with do I need to do like a residency similar to nursing?

"Should I move? Advice needed","Im 20F and in college rn. A good friend of mine asked me a few days ago if I wanted to move into an apartment with her, and I don't know if I should do it. I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons here. I'm worried I'm going to make the wrong decision. I'm barely an adult so I don't know what I'm doing really. 
 - - -
I'm about to go into my 3rd year of college, and I'm currently renting a 3 bed 2 bath house off-campus with 3 other girls. It's super close to campus, so it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to get to class from home depending on if traffic is bad. Its been so so convenient being this close. Even the church I go to is on campus. I got lucky and pay decently low rent monthly which includes all the utilities, electricity, etc. The only thing extra I pay is for wifi. And its a nice place. I have my own room which was a big upgrade from dorm life. I also moved in with the house basically being furnished. We're renting through my roommate's mom, and she loves interior design, so she basically furnished the place herself, and it looks really nice and feels homey. I also don't have to worry about any noisy upstairs neighbors.

The cons though are that we're very often having issues with the AC and water heater and we often have to call someone to fix it just for it to act up again not long later. Its not the safest area either, a little bit the opposite actually. My neighborhood is kind of like its own bubble and is relatively safe, but the immediate surrounding areas are definitely not the place you wanna find yourself in at night. If I need to go to the store I have to drive a decent ways down the road, too. Its also a good 30 minutes commute to my current job, which I don't really mind all that much. I'm also very often home alone. My roommates like to spend time a lot of with their family, while I usually stay at the house, and we all have very different schedules anyway, so I dont see them a lot, especially not during the summer. I've been alone at the house for months now. I'm conflicted whether or not I enjoy or hate that. Its gets unbearably lonely sometimes, but I also really need alone time, and I'm not very close with my roommates. I've known them since I started college but we're still in the awkward small talk phase almost two years later because we hardly ever interact. When we're all home, I usually end up staying (hiding) in my room or will just awkwardly be on the couch while the others talk. It feels awkward and like I'm out of place. I get self conscious being in my own home sometimes. 
 - - -
Now for the new place. Its a 2 bed 2 bath apartment. The rent is about $100 more monthly than what I currently pay, which includes all utilities except* electricity and wifi. The electricity bill apparently isn't bad though. I'd also be moving in with a friend who I know a lot better and feel more comfortable with. We get along pretty well. Its a pretty good location, too. The complex itself is in a pretty secluded spot but is also pretty close to a busier road with lots of stores and things nearby. Its a better part of town. 

The only things I'm worried about are the fact that it's much farther from my school's campus, about 20 minutes, but it's also a little closer to my job, and my commute to work would be more like 20 minutes instead of 30. Also the rent. I have no idea what to expect with fees and whatnot. Again, I got lucky that it was so simple with my current housing and been very reliable and consistent. I'm worried that the new place is going to have some hidden fees or weird rules or something ontop of the higher rent from what I pay now. This also might sound picky, but we probably wouldnt have much furniture for the new place. My friend was talking about buying a couch though. Pretty much any furniture I'd bring is for my room and probably wouldn't work anywhere else.
 - - -
I think most of my fears around this are the unknowns. My friend messaged me 2 days ago about it so I don't have a ton of information yet. She toured the place a few hours ago and said it was really nice. She also has a friend who moved into the same unit last week who said good things about the place and the pricing. 
I'm wondering though if I should stick with what I have because it's so stable: low rent, pretty much no variable fees or payments, the lady I rent through is super nice and relaxed, I get the house to myself a lot, etc. But I have no idea what I'm getting myself into with the new place. Also the timing has me anxious, because I'm going to need to make a decision soon, and I feel a little rushed. I don't want to make a decision hasilty or impulsively and regret it. But the lady we rent through (my roommate's mom) today texted all of us about renewing our lease for this year. I'm going to need to let her know ASAP if I actually decide to move.
I'm planning on scheduling a tour for the apartment soon and getting more information.

Any advice? Because I have no idea what I'm doing or how to adult. This is making me anxious. Would moving be worth it? ","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m92tm6/should_i_move_advice_needed/","1753458701.0","Adulting","naomi_macaroni"

"What is love ???","I, 18 M is never been in a relationship.

What is love , this word came to me when i 12 year old a few people in class started dating each other but i didn't give shit then but when i was 15 , I was interested in so called ""love"" so i wanted to date someone. So I'm type of guy who trys to understand something before doing it so, i asked my friends who was and is dating and all they gave me was bull shit like ""you will know when it comes"",""idk bro i can't explain it"" or ""you will get it at some point "" like wtf so of course i was confused so i gave up and focused on myself...

And i didn't have up so easily so i was trying to get the answer myself and asked my friends ""why did you love her, why her"" they came up with different answer some said ""personality"" some said ""character"" some said ""her body"" some said ""i like her whom she is"" so of course i didn't get it at all.. and of course i was attracted to some girls but this girl are not your typical avg girl (girl in malls or who is super hot) but i know that I'm out of their league and i won't see then in regular base..

I was not attracted to anyone in my school so i didn't have anyone to approach. At a point i thought ""maybe I'm gay"" but I'm not gay I was still attracted to super hot girl..

But something changed when i was 16 I liked a girl and it because i had a desire that before finishing school in wanted to have this Teen love . So when I was kid I fell in love with black widow from Avengers so because of her I had a thing for short hair girls...
So there was a argument between my class boy ""who is the prettiest girl in our school"" so i didn't have anyone to said A (let say that the girl is ""A"") and everyone was surprised and they started to tease me by her name we where we Cross into her (she was not in our ,we were at different sections) so there was a chance for me to talk to her and  i did (my voice broked alot) she followed me on insta that night and we talked for a few months and she knew that I like her but she didn't want that she just want someone to talk to soo... She rejected me before i could confess well after that things got so weird we got the same math teacher so we got class together and that was soo awkward and I was pathetic there because every mf knew that I got rejected and there she was as usual but me ,my eyes was soo filled with water that i could almost cried but no i didn't...

I know my love was a failing love because all the messages I send with love and my honest feelings all she gave back was nothing but a dry ass message and she used to left me on Read so many time but i always convensed myself that she is busy with something but no she was texting someone else...

Still today i think about her sometimes but i know that she didn't give a damn about me ...

Well maybe love isn't for me it like God is forbiddening me from fall in love . Well I'm supposed to good looking atleast that what others say . When i say i never dated anyone every single time people don't believe me idk what is wrong with me but well in still young so let's see maybe I may fall in love at some point and finally know ""what is love""........","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1m98w5t/what_is_love/","1753472697.0","Adulting","JJ0yson"
"Men, why do you want to date women you don't want to date?","Over half the posts i get from here are men complaining about women. I don't get it. You see men complain about something women do and get frustrated with it, as they won't be able to date them. 

  
So, men, why are you so adamant to be upset over people that \*you don't want either way\*, literally their loss. Instead of looking for someone else you somehow want people change how they are for you, that just seems unproductive, what even interests you in these women in the first place when you seem to dislike them so much? Isn't that just a bullet dodged for you? 

  
Like the post i just got with the top comment complaining about mentally unstable women, just don't date them? Why are you interested enough in them in the first place to feel the need to get so upset if they do this thing that upsets you?! I don't hear the same from women usually.

"Trying to balance health, body image, and advice from doctors‚Ä¶ is this what adulting feels like?","
I‚Äôm 18, 161 cm tall, and weigh about 43 kg.
Recently, a doctor told me I should weigh 53 kg ‚Äúideally,‚Äù and it completely threw me off. I‚Äôve been focused on losing fat (belly, chest, face), not gaining weight ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm stuck in this weird adulting loop where I‚Äôm questioning everything I thought was healthy.

I don‚Äôt go to the gym. I eat vegetarian, stay in a hostel, avoid junk, and I walk daily. I‚Äôm not starving myself ‚Äî I just want to feel good and look a little more toned.
But some days I feel too skinny. Other days I feel bloated and heavy. The mirror plays mind games, and social media makes it worse.

So here I am, trying to understand:
‚Üí Is it normal to feel this confused about health at 18?
‚Üí Am I overthinking ‚Äúfat loss‚Äù at this weight?
‚Üí Or is this just the start of figuring out what being healthy actually means?

I‚Äôm not here for compliments

Anyone else been through something similar?

"Should I change my major to Med Lab Science?","I (23F) need some advice. I'm currently going into my junior year of college, and my plan thus far has been to get my degree in Biology and go to grad school or professional school in the medical field. 

However, I recently learned about a Med Lab Science degree program at my university, which in my state would land me a job making ~$60k with one extra year of undergrad straight out. Also, I work full time at the university, and I would be able to get this degree essentially debt-free.

I'm conflicted though, as I've always wanted to be hands-on helping others. It's my passion and I always felt I could achieve that through being an instructor or working in medicine. I doubt I could get that life fulfillment in Med Lab Science. 

Additionally, I always wanted to have ""the college experience,"" (working only part-time to focus on academics, kind of my dream for my youth) and my husband and I agreed I would get the chance when we earned our Bachelor's (I am also getting him through school debt-free). I never had the opportunity to since my parents refused to sign the FAFSA, and Ive worked full time since I was 18.

I know the financially smarter option would be to pursue the degree in Med Lab Science, but I still have this conflict. Any advice about making such a decision?","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1m9ctxd/should_i_change_my_major_to_med_lab_science/","1753482308.0","college","2020akat"
"HELP AHHHH COLLEGE IS SCARY (Going into my 3rd year)","The long and short of it is that I'm pre-nursing right now, just finished my first year of pre requisites, my first year of college I took Biology and got EMT certified, only to learn my city doesn't hire EMT's under 21. I want to say I learned a lot that first year, and I did to an extent, I decided to change my major from Life Sciences to Pre-Nursing, but now I'm not sure if nursing is for me. 

I went and spoke to my counselor yesterday and am now considering getting back on Life Sciences for Pre-Med, or Animal Sciences for Pre-Vet, I have shadowed doctors before and can't say I felt any real pull towards the profession, but veterinary medicine does sound interesting, and I enjoy working with and learning about animals, I plan on shadowing my local vet soon to get a better idea about what the job is like. 

Ontop of all of this, I need to decide on a school to transfer to as I'm currently enrolled at a community college, and where I'm going to study abroad, hopefully starting Fall 2026. I'd love to get the opinion of other people on nursing vs pre-med. I really struggled my first year at college and had to drop pre-calculus because I couldn't handle the workload on-top of biology, but I really find the content interesting and feel like I'll be selling myself short by not taking STEM classes, but they also make me want to die. 

Very few of my nursing pre requisites count towards pre-med classes so I'm also stressed about having to start another 2 years of pre requisites, but I suppose that's silly in the grand scheme of things, and not something I should be worrying about if my goal is to find the right career for me. 

This is all a big thought bomb that's been packed in my brain so I apologize if I've not done a great job of explaining my predicament, and I'm happy to elaborate and clarify.

"I have no idea what to do","I'm an upcoming senior in high school (about a week away from going back to school). I have a good GPA (4.09 weighted), but almost no awards and my EC record is nonexistent. I have clubs, but I'm only active in one volunteering club and only participate occasionally. My test scores are average and my admissions essay draft is actual garbage because I feel like I have nothing to talk about. 

I'm going to my state's college, but I know I'm not going to score good scholarships (meaning that it will pay most or all of my tuition) because I'm not well rounded. I also won't receive that much financial help because my parents' combined salary isn't low enough for significant aid. We don't have money to pay out of pocket though.

I'm wondering whether I should just send my application early for priority or wait a bit later until I can add a little extra to my application (I'm taking the SAT again and joining new ECs). If I submit it now, it will be considerably empty in terms of activities, and I have no idea whether it will be considered even if I submit it early for that reason. My college has merit based scholarships based on GPA, but some of them will only cover about a fourth of regular tuition, and some that cover all are extremely competitive (they go to less than a hundred people). People say I should apply for them anyway, but I don't know when I should, and I'm likely not going to score them regardless. I'm not even sure whether or not test scores are taken into account, because my school is test optional and they don't mention it anywhere on the scholarship pages. I can't look at a recommended catalog for scholarships in my state yet because it isn't open for the 26-27 year, and I have no idea when it will open or if I'll find anything I can apply for easily.

What do you guys think the easiest route I should take if I want to cover majority of my tuition? I'm still clueless about financial stuff and I don't know what to do with less than a month. I also don't have anyone who was in my situation to help me, and I'm not in school yet. They might help us when we get back but I need help early so I can act early.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1m9gb9g/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do/","1753491772.0","ApplyingToCollege","Cosm1cLaziness"
"Run-in with new neighbours - what do I do?","Okay, so, me (21F) and my husband (21M) are moving into a new place. It's a lovely house and we were so excited because we've only lived in 1 bed flats before. 

My husband is staying in the old place tonight because he has work and I am in the new place to get a furniture delivery in the morning. 

My friend (gender-neutral but AFAB, 21) has a big car and has driven up to help us move. 

The hill is steep and tight but there was a big space at the top. It was late (1am I think) because its a really long drive. 

My friend is at the top turning when a man comes out shouting, swearing and filming my friend. In a panic they reverse back a little and bump my car. The man then tries to open the door over and over again and then takes the keys out of the ignition and won't give them back. 

My friend is kind of frozen now because they don't have their keys, but if they leave the car this man could just drive off and he has already tried to get in the car.

Another woman comes out calling my friend a bitch. My friend rings me asking me to come out and I could tell something was wrong from their voice.

I come out and they start saying oh you know this person etc. And I say it's fine if they hit my car I'll deal with it, but they're saying they've also hit their car? They're both still shouting and swearing at us. The man is now saying I'm terrible as well because I nearly hit a car when I drove up and all this stuff, saying kids live here I could've hit a kid? I don't even think I did nearly hit a car when I came up?
I just sort of stand there trying really hard not to cry. Then eventually muster - what would you like us to do now? I did also manage to say that we have just moved, but I didn't manage to say it was literally this morning we got the keys. 

They sort of say something about damages then ask me to move my car back, so that my friend could get out, so I do. 

The man then insists on moving my friends car. 

They ask me to move my car again but I don't understand where they want me to go. I move it back a bit and he says he can move it. 

I'm shaking and crying at this point so I just let him (I know I shouldn't have but there's no way I could've moved it).

As I already knew, there was no damage to their car (because my friend hadn't even touched it! I had a look before they moved!) And not even any damage to my car which they had very gently bumped. 

Another woman comes out and both the women are saying it's fine now but the man is still grumpy about something. 

My friend moved their car to the bottom of the hill and I waited in the house having a mild panic attack.

So, I guess, what do we even do?! Do we grovel to the neighbours? Was him taking my friends keys even legal? I don't even know I'm just really overwhelmed we have to live opposite them now and I never want to drive up that hill again.

Now to clarify what i mean by dead: I go outside and feel as though that there's very little to do, nobody wants to talk and nothing to see, it's like i wasn't made for it.

I felt this way as a kid, and as an adult its even worse, since you're not guaranteed social interaction at your job like you were at school.

  
I've been a shut-in my whole life, i only really go out with friends with family, and the reason for that is because i just don't see the point of going outside. Now i do enjoy doing a great many things alone, it just so happens all of them are on my pc.

I have no memories of any walk i ever took through any park, i've never spoken to a stranger in a caf√© after a lifetime attending them. The few times i've had actual conversations with complete randos outside are just neutral or boring. Closest to positive was some crazy old men telling me absolute nonsense, which was at least funny.

I can and have approached people but it gets tiring and its just plain boring when you realize that few people have much to say to a guy they've just met.

It's not even that i feel society is negative, it's overwhelmingly neutral and most daily interactions i have are somewhat quite pleasant. Lots of ""good day"", smiling, people saying ""excuse me"" whenever they wanna shuffle past me. I actually have maybe a couple of negative memories in about 4-5 years of riding a subway multiple times a day almost every day. 

I often feel as though there's no alternative to lonely people the internet, when i had no friends and nobody to talk to the easiest way to guarantee i'd talk to no one was by going outside and not stay online.

I often felt a great disconnect whenever i try to talk people about this. Replies i get usually boil down to: assuming i have anxiety disorder (which i don't have), telling me to go to church (and im not religious), talking about how shit society is (which i don't believe it is) or basically dismissing everything i said and saying im doing a usual shpeal about feelings of complete apathy (which is not what this is about).

I have things i like, friends i like to be with, activities i enjoy doing. But just going outside on my own honestly always felt less social than being inside.

Everytime i go outside i feel like there's nothing out there for me. In truth, i always felt there wasn't.

"Trying to level up my life, but my parents keep pulling me back","I'm 26 and currently working part-time in retail, but my store refuses to give me more hours. So, I‚Äôve been job hunting and just landed an interview for a position 45 minutes away from where I live. I'm hoping it could turn into something full-time or even a coordinator role, since I‚Äôve built up almost a year of retail sales experience.

Here‚Äôs the complicated part, my mom just got a job near that area too, and suddenly she‚Äôs really worried about me driving back home at night. The store closes at 8 PM, and I‚Äôd be driving home at a reasonable hour, but she‚Äôs treating it like it‚Äôs unsafe or irresponsible. My parents also said they can‚Äôt afford a third car, but they won‚Äôt share anything about their finances with me, which makes it hard to understand the full picture.

I‚Äôm doing my best to take real steps toward independence, but it feels like every time I try, I get pulled back by family dynamics that don‚Äôt respect that I‚Äôm an adult. I get that I still live in their house, and yes, they pay the bills, but I‚Äôm trying to move forward and make progress. It‚Äôs discouraging when the people closest to you don‚Äôt seem to support that.

"Someone started a rumor that I cheated, how do I handle this?","For context, I‚Äôve been in a rocky relationship for 6 months. Around a month ago, my bf got physical with me and broke up with me (he was in the middle of what I can only describe as a mental breakdown) and from there on out we were on a break for a week and a half. At work, I have a friend who he went through the same exact situation with his ex gf. I had work maybe three hours after the mental breakdown had happened and I was obviously visibly upset. He found my number on the work schedules app (yes they display your email and number for coworkers to reach you if you need a shift covered) and texted me saying I was welcome to discuss what happened the night I was broken up with and I vented to him about the situation. Within the next week we became good friends over the situation while I was a on break with bf, however we never texted after that night where I vented, and strictly spoke if anything was going on during work, and he‚Äôd give me advice. 
The girls who started this rumor stated that ‚ÄúI had a bf the entire time I was speaking to this friend of mine at work‚Äù when they never bothered to ask any timeline or what had happened during that timeframe, if we had broken up, or anything to that degree. Instead, they decided to text my bf and ask his side of the situation. (He claims he does not remember any of it, what I‚Äôm guessing was probably a bipolar shift or whatever they call it, psychosis?) I confronted them after they came to my best friends who obviously shut it down the second they tried talking crap, but they continue to do so to everyone I work with. I‚Äôve already quit my job because between the toxicity and the hate I will probably receive for false accusations is not worth 13 dollars an hourüíÄ. But I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to what I should do. I don‚Äôt know if it will get around to my school since it‚Äôs still summer, and I‚Äôm more worried it will get to my boyfriend. Knowing his state and mental health he will not take an accusation like that lightly, and I don‚Äôt blame him, but I don‚Äôt think he would even consider to give me benefit of the doubt. I can‚Äôt believe something so minor as confiding in someone who was in the same situation I was in was turned to such a major rumor. NOT TO MENTION, a coworker of mine(who left around 8 months ago) I had a relationship with cheated on me, and when I made it known (I had proof as well) those SAME TWO GIRLS did not defend me and instead brushed it off! It‚Äôs so double standard, I‚Äôm just distraught.

"What would you do to make it a little better?","Im currently in a weird funk. I was laid off 45 days ago - mass layoff. I only have enough funds to last me another 2 to 3 months. 

I live with family because prior to getting laid off I was working on saving and paying off debt to be able to move out because the household is stressful and toxic. 

Most friends are doing their own thing so we dont talk or hang out often. 

And I started grad school a few weeks prior to getting laid off 

So right now things are sad and it feels alone. I spend my day doing homework, applying to jobs and just staying home in a toxic environment and if im not dealing with that im worried about running out of money soon.

"How do I get my parents to pay me back without kicking them while they are down?","Don't know if this is the best subreddit so I apologize but here we go: I 29(F) am a first generation in America. My parents came from Lebanon when they got married and settled here wanting to build a better life for themselves and for their kids. I have a brother who is 35. Culturally, there is no such thing as a 401k in our culture and your retirement plans are basically living with your kids. I have accepted this and so has my brother.

  
Over the last few years, my parent's business really suffered. They were barely making it back from 2008 when Covid hit and it seems like they cannot catch a break. This resulted them borrowing my life savings of over $100,000. My plan was to finish paying off my student loans and put the rest towards a property I can live in and rent out rooms or a duplex so that I do not have to work for Corporate America forever. 

  
I have repeatedly asked my parents to put together a plan to pay me back as they have already set me back on my goals by 2 years. I have told them to hire a financial planner, but they are scared that they cannot afford it, or find a non-profit that would help them but their excuse is always they forgot or dont have time. They really do work long hours but they do not feel in a rush to give me or my brother, who invested another $100,000 with them, our money back. 

  
When I bring it up, they say they are trying and to not kick them while they are down. They have loans with very high interest rates, probably some that are around 40% so it seems like they are never going to be able to get out of debt and pay us back and I see why they feel like they are drowning. I also do not want to hrie the financial planner for them or find  resources for them because I have been the parent in my home for long enough and they need to figure this one out on their own. 

  
I always bail them out and yes, that is my fault, but I have stopped because they need to stand on their own two feet and although I am so grateful that they have supported me, I have been paying all of my own bills for the last decade, they need to do the same.

TLDR im cracked at school. at my new school my GPA is gonna get a recalc and i believe it's gonna be around 5.0 weighted and exactly 4.0 UW. i'm pretty sure i'd be valedictorian if I wasn't prohibited from being it (school policy says I can't be val if I don't attend at least three years :p)

however I'm also a lazy fucking bum and have essentially no ECs. the one EC i have is that last year I won a statewide journalism contest (but it was in 6 divisions and i only won in my division, not overall for the state). i don't even want to go into journalism I only did it cause my buddy convinced me to.

I've been really depressed for the past year and it's been blocking me from getting into what I think I want to do (game dev with Godot, yes I know it's a pipe dream that's not what I'm here to talk about). I'm telling myself to get my shit together for junior year. I'm gonna get a new psychiatrist and work out my executive dysfunction and maybe the depression (i'm already medicated but it doesn't really solve the issue of passion for me, it actually takes away from it more). i've been off my adhd medication for a while and I'm going to try and get a new one.

All that depression and my lack of ability to do the things I want has clouded my judgment about my future, so I'm looking for outside advice now. vbasically my question is with these stats, am I throwing a good opportunity away if I don't lock in this year and try to get into like a T20? Is it too late? Is it even worth the effort? (especially if I go into computer science, which I probably am gonna end up doing and then hating myself for later) It's been really hard for me to find motivation lately to do anything lately and I think I need a wakeup call. People have told me all my life that I'm MIT material but I just don't see it and I certainly don't feel it. 

I will be applying to MIT (contractual obligation with a friend of mine) but besides that I'm just not sure if I should try to get in anywhere other than my state school. I'm pretty concerned about the cost of college for me (I probably won't be getting aid, and living on campus probably won't be an option for me since I have a very anxious cat who I really can't leave behind to go off to college) and I don't want to end up in crippling debt for a CS degree of all things. I'm thinking to get a lot more AP credits so I can hopefully skip a year or two of college. My state school would make that pretty easy, T20s might not. I'm really not sure, and I'd be happy to hear any advice. I feel really lost right now. 

(Also trying to pick out classes next year. is spamming APs a terrible idea? I had five last year and I was fine, slept through most of World. i was thinking i might sign up for 6 or 7 ap classes and self study lang. lang test looks really easy but the class sounds evil)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mb9wxe/rising_junior_should_i_aim_for_t20sivy_with/","1753688245.0","ApplyingToCollege","strawberry_jaaam"
"I feel lost","When i graduated high school in 2022 my mom put me under a lot of pressure to enroll in university. I had no idea what I wanted to study and I believe that a gap year would have been nice. I needed time to think about what to do next. However since I didn't want to make her disappointed, I enrolled in a major that was not something I was interested in. I tried to make it work for 2 years, but it just wasn't for me. During that time I got a job and got used to working and making my own money. Last year I dropped out because I couldn't take it anymore. I took a year off and I just went to work and did some IT courses to keep myself busy.

Ultimately I found a major that I was interested in and could afford it. Last month I applied and I wasn't accepted sadly. My heart broke. There is another course that I am interested in and still have time to apply, however it's way out of my budget and I would need a lot of help from my mom. I never considered it because it is way too expensive, but it definitely is something i want to study.

My boyfriend is starting university and he is so hyped, I'm happy for him, he worked really hard. I believe that's  how it should be. You should be excited to go, ready to learn and change. I am worried that this difference is going to drive us apart. 

My plans are either to try to enroll now and work a lot so I can afford it or wait another year so I can save up more money and try again, but I'm going to be 23 years old and I feel guilty about it. 

I don't know what to do. I feel lost and afraid. Now that I'm older I feel ready for this next chapter and I kind of regret listening to my mom back then. I never was a lazy child, I just needed some time and understanding. I can't dwell on the past, but I definitely don't want to make the same mistake as last time.

"AMA about how I improved my application and got into all the schools I wanted","Hey guys! Whenever I comment about my college acceptances as a high schooler and as a transfer on TikTok, I always get a lot of DMs asking about how the process went for me, so I decided to make a post on here. For context during high school admissions, I got into some good schools, but definitely underperformed compared to what I was expecting with my stats and ECs. I got into my flagship in-state public university (t25), as well as another in-state school that was well ranked for my major, and a T15 liberal arts college. I was rejected from every <15% acceptance rate school I applied to and went to the t25. As a transfer, I got into 4/5 schools I applied to, ranging from a 20% to 6% transfer acceptance rates. These schools were Wellesley (13%), Wesleyan (20%), Barnard (20%), and Middlebury (6%). These are all top 15 liberal arts colleges, with Middlebury, Barnard, and Wellesley being particularly prestigious. I was rejected from Amherst (9%), which mainly accepts community college students. 

I decided I wanted to transfer because I wanted a smaller environment. The school I attended was not my first choice. I wanted to go to the liberal arts college, but I was talked out of that choice by family and family friends. When I got to campus, I knew I had made a mistake and was already thinking about transferring to a top liberal arts college. I think my application quality, in terms of ECs was the same as in high school, and grade-wise was a bit worse (I had earned a B+ in my first term), but I had much better results because I actually knew what I wanted in a school and environment, which shined in my essays. I was also super depressed, so my letters of recommendation probably sucked. If anyone has any questions on how to build a list of schools, how to improve essays, format ECs, build up an application to transfer, or even how to choose a school (I think I got much better at that the second time around lmao), go ahead and ask.  I will do my best to answer. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mb34c1/ama_about_how_i_improved_my_application_and_got/","1753665439.0","ApplyingToCollege","Strange_Bar_4200"

"Why Are We Still Paying for School Lunch? High Schoolers CAN Push for Change","We‚Äôre legally required to be in school all day ‚Äî 6 to 8 hours. We can‚Äôt leave. We don‚Äôt get paid. And then on top of that, we‚Äôre expected to pay to eat?

That‚Äôs crazy. Food is not some extra service ‚Äî it‚Äôs a basic need. Hungry students can‚Äôt learn, can‚Äôt focus, and honestly just suffer. You‚Äôd think the one place that‚Äôs supposed to be about learning would make sure every kid is fed without turning it into a luxury.

So‚Ä¶ what can we do as high schoolers?

We‚Äôre not little kids anymore. We understand systems, we vote in school elections, and some of us will vote for real in a year or two. And we can do something about this if we organize. Here‚Äôs a plan:


Step 1: Get Your Facts Straight

Look up whether your school or district gets federal or state lunch support.

Check if your school already offers free or reduced lunch and how many students qualify.

Find examples of other districts or states that made school meals free for all (California, Maine, etc.).



Step 2: Build a Formal Proposal (Short & Clear)

You don‚Äôt need to write a novel. Just include:

The problem (many can‚Äôt afford lunch, and some skip meals because of it)

The impact (learning, mental health, school performance)

What you're asking (free meals for all students)

A few examples of other schools that have done it



Step 3: Gather Support

Get students to sign the proposal ‚Äî digital or paper (Google Forms works)

Ask a couple of teachers to back it (especially ones that students and admins respect)

Reach out to parents too. If parents send formal letters or emails, it adds real pressure.



Step 4: Deliver It

Send your proposal and signatures to:

The principal or headmaster

School board or district officials (CC them in emails)

Parent-Teacher Associations

Even your local newspaper if you want to go hard


 Bonus: Talk About It

Bring it up in student council or any rep body if your school has one.

Post about it on social (Instagram stories, etc.).

Keep it respectful but loud. This matters.


Final Thought:

This is not some far-off dream. It‚Äôs already happening in other places. If enough students, parents, and teachers speak up ‚Äî school boards have to listen.

We‚Äôre not asking for free concert tickets. We‚Äôre asking for basic food in a place we are legally forced to attend.

Let‚Äôs not wait for someone else to fix it. If we move together, we can make this happen.

"Is doing an internship at the same time as my first semester a stupid thing to do?","So, I'm starting college as a freshman this fall. Thinking about starting college has made me think even more about the career I hope to have and how much I want it. So I've been impatient to get ahead in work experience, and with some searching I found a remote internship for 10 hours a week. The length of the internship would be this September through December. I've decided to apply even though I doubt I'll get it, because, why not? But on the off chance that I do get accepted - would it be absolutely stupid to be doing an internship at the same time that I'm settling in/getting used to college? I'm not worried about the respective time commitments per se, since it's the same as if I got a part time job, which I already hoped to do... more so the potential for overwhelm and burnout. It'd be a lot of writing, thinking, and computer work, more so than I'd already have. Plus I've never moved before, so just being in a new place will be a big adjustment. And yet I'd really love to do the internship if possible, it's exactly the kind of thing I want to pursue.

"Should I stick with a CS degree I don‚Äôt love just to graduate sooner?","I‚Äôm 30 and have been working and going to school part-time for the past 10 years. I finally have full-time support to finish my degree‚Äîbut now I‚Äôm facing a tough decision about what major to finish with.

I was pursuing Computer Science, but I‚Äôve never been passionate about coding. I recently switched to Engineering Management with a CS focus because I enjoy business and leadership a lot more. The problem? That switch added 15 more classes, meaning I‚Äôd need to stay an extra semester.

If I just stick with CS, I have 10 classes left and can graduate on time. With Engineering Management, I‚Äôd be in school longer and take on more debt‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm really trying to avoid.

Some background:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve worked in the restaurant industry for over a decade (management + operations), which gave me a lot of experience in leadership and problem-solving.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôd love to work in product or project management after school.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not chasing a ‚Äúdream job‚Äù‚Äîjust something stable in the $70‚Äì85K range so I can pay off debt and get on my feet.


Is it worth sticking it out in CS just to finish faster, even if I don‚Äôt love it? Or should I take longer and pursue something more aligned with my interests?

"$130k in debt for Engineering Bachelor‚Äôs Degree","Hello, I am looking into attending my local in-state college at Rutgers University. After running the numbers, after maxing out my federal loans, I would be looking at about $80k extra in private loans (around $110k total) throughout 4 years there to cover the gap between federal loan coverage and total cost of attendance. 

I am planning on living on campus all four years as I am not close to the university and would consider off-campus but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs unsafe over there. 

After interest accrual & once payoff begins, the loan balance is projected to grow to $130k. 

My private loans interest rates will be around 7-8% and federal loan ones around 4-5%. I am looking to get a degree in Civil Engineering which is a good major hence why I‚Äôm considering this.

(FIRST)
What‚Äôs a significant challenge you have faced that affected your academics 


There are many ways to eat an elephant. In the dry California air, I could feel the bite of a November cross‚Äëcountry meet pressing in on my stomach. In front of me, something startled the restless crowd; the cramped pain in my gut pierced the air, it was my IBS, off the start line, out of control. I looked away; cold nausea met asphalt, and I hit the grass.
For the next few months, I was immobilized and struggled to recuperate. My body was so weak I could hardly run three hundred yards on my own. I struggled to solve homework, grasp new lessons, and maintain focus during class. For the rest of freshman year, every time I asked to leave for the restroom, I would hear a faint sigh from the back of the classroom. Weighed down by my lack of energy and confidence, these problems inevitably affected my academic progress and semester grades. How was I going to eat this elephant, this daunting and overwhelming obstacle?
I struggled significantly in one class in particular English 9. When the teacher, Ms.Ribli, noticed that I seemed withdrawn, she reached out to me and asked me to stay after class. My eyes filled up with tears as I explained my flare‚Äëups, my dad‚Äôs job loss, and the late‚Äënight supermarket shifts I worked. Without hesitation, she offered me a plan and gave me advice that still resonates within me today. Her words, filled with patience and structure, slowed the rampant pounding of my heart and restored my determination.
We worked together on make‚Äëup packets and time‚Äëmanagement strategies weekly. On my own, I would religiously inject my weekly medication, log every meal in my phone, and review English concepts during lunch and breaks. Not only did the lessons Ms.Ribli taught me apply to English, but they also applied in daily life; she changed my approach to difficult situations.
At the end of each month, I felt empowered, capable, and confident as my exam scores began to improve little by little with each session, she offered to guide me. Now, rather than looking at difficult problems as one huge task, I tackle obstacles a bite at a time.


(SECOND)
What have you done to make your school or your community a better place

I began my fifth‚Äëgrade year having just moved to a new school, away from everything and everyone I knew. As a ginger middle child whose parents were fighting through a long divorce, I already knew I was different, but I had no idea how different I really was.
For one school project we were instructed to create a family tree, and I realized I could fill only half the branches. It was a cold November morning, and I stood in front of the class with a poster covered in question marks where my biological father‚Äôs side should be. As I taped it to the board, I heard one classmate say, ‚ÄúMissing half of the tree. Did you run out of time?‚Äù I felt my face grow hot with dread and embarrassment.
From that day on, I did whatever I could to never feel that way again or make anyone else feel that way.
This commitment has stayed with me throughout my life and is at the core of my role as a leader in our Police Explorers. In this role I represent my post at city safety meetings, giving me a platform to ensure everyone‚Äôs voice is heard and included. I also represent the post on campus, successfully encouraging five friends from class to join our weekly drills. While the purpose of our group is to learn public‚Äësafety skills, we are also a team of students from different families, united by a shared passion for serving our community.
Ultimately, this program has become a way for people to come together, something I have worked toward my whole life, through planning events and ride‚Äëalong nights where everyone is welcome. I see bettering my community as more than the literal sense; I make my community a better place by connecting people. Everyone deserves to feel like they belong somewhere, especially a place where they can be at ease and true to themselves. I am dedicated to doing my part to ensure no one in my community feels the way I did that day in fifth grade.

Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside the classroom.

Discovering Economics near the end of my sophomore year felt like the final piece of a puzzle clicking into place. It's the perfect intersection of everything I love to do and everything I excel at. My love for markets started in elementary school selling candy for a profit and grew throughout high school, where I got my first job at a store that had a Pok√©mon machine selling under market value, so during my shifts I bought the packs and flipped them online for a profit. Over the past year, community service projects and leadership positions have further improved my business skills. Understanding how money moves is something I'm genuinely good at, so the economics major felt like a naturally perfect fit.

Although I haven't always been a strong economist, my recent experiences ‚Äì setting up a budget system for a local drone shop and managing a $10,000+ investment account have greatly improved my skills. When business started declining at a drone shop I do community service for, I took the initiative to create a referral program and launch student discounts that boosted our sales. The program‚Äôs success boosted demand and drew in students from nearby schools, making me an unofficial ‚Äúbrand ambassador.‚Äù At the weekend drone lessons, I learned how to share my ideas with adults in a professional setting and to present price options to families..

My community college classes thus far, especially ECON 1, have taught me how to analyze markets more effectively with peers and develop my presentation skills. Speaking to an audience through a spreadsheet of stock data is very different from speaking to an in‚Äëperson audience, but this class helped me draw a connection between the two and recognize their similarities. For example, one of my most memorable trades involved watching a four‚Äëthousand‚Äëdollar paper loss on NVIDIA recover into profit, a trade I showed my class how to read candle sticks and swing a share price. It was surprisingly fun, and they loved it.

Overall, these experiences have come together to solidify my love for economics, and I am confident that UC is the ideal place to continue my journey.

Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.
When I first began working at Safeway at fifteen as a courtesy clerk, I never imagined myself as a leader. I was just the kid pushing carts in the rain and bagging groceries as quickly as possible to keep the lines moving.
Honestly, it felt more like a sport, and every shift was like game day. I would get overwhelmed if I was paired with a fast checker and hoped I wouldn't get thrown into a situation I couldn't handle. I kept my head down and focused on learning as much as I could without messing anything up.
I got better over time at learning routines faster, staying calm under pressure, and covering for my teammates. Managers noticed, and a few months later, new hires began shadowing me during their first shifts.
At first, I wanted to make sure they got through the shift without messing up. As I saw them improve, I developed a real sense of pride in helping my new coworkers gain confidence. I would go over recurring problems, like what to do when we ran out of bags or how to restart the self-checkout machines. These were things I wished someone had told me on day one. I often stuck around after my shifts to walk new clerks through closing procedures they hadn‚Äôt been taught.
I came to realize that leadership is more about setting the tone through my actions rather than handing out tasks or telling people what to do. When I came in early, stayed calm during rushes, and worked hard without complaining, others usually followed my lead.
As I gained more experience, I started helping beyond my role by jumping into other departments, restocking dairy, assisting with inventory checks, and covering for supervisors when they were unavailable. I earned trust by showing I could keep my head in the game even when everything around me was falling apart. Now, at 17, I‚Äôve begun training to be a PIC. I take pride in stepping into leadership and supporting others the way I wish someone had supported me.

And I‚Äôm struggling with day to day responsibilities feel like I‚Äôm living in chaos.


I bought a house as a 26 years old women. It was my first house, I could really only afford fixer uppers. I worked on the inside with my dads help the the projects I‚Äôm doing by myself I keep messing up. 

For example, I tried fixing a broken fence post and added a wheel to help the gate open, but it doesn't work right. So now I‚Äôll have to redo it. I pulled up old laminate flooring in the laundry room, but the remover got on my freshly painted walls ‚Äî now I have to redo those too. Nothing seems to go right the first time, and it‚Äôs exhausting.

The biggest issue right now is the siding and windows. I assumed the contractor would handle the permit, but it turned out I had to file it myself. I also didn‚Äôt think to ask if they‚Äôd need to remove the fence post for the siding install ‚Äî again, I just didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to ask.

Then, they said I should replace some of the exterior doors, but I can't afford that right now. It feels like the project is ballooning and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll never be able to finish everything this house needs.

To make things worse, they tucked the fiber internet cable behind the siding ‚Äî and afterward, my internet stopped working. So I called my provider, and they came out and installed a new line, but it looks terrible. Now the contractor is mad they drilled into the new siding, but the internet company says they had no choice. I might try to paint the wire so it‚Äôs less noticeable, but it just feels like a lose-lose.

I struggle with communicating clearly ‚Äî I don‚Äôt always know the right questions to ask or how to set expectations with contractors or companies. And beyond all that, I‚Äôm falling behind on everyday stuff: cooking dinner, cleaning the floors, keeping clutter under control. The whole house feels like a mess, and I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart with it.

"Is it really this hard to make friends? (21M) Advice on what I'm doing wrong?","I (21M) haven't made friends in college over 3 years, other than passing acquaintances, and I don't know what's going on. 

I've had such a miserable experience here when it seems like everyone's gone on trips with friends, spends every weekend with friends, and room with friends while watching movies with friends, while I spend so much time alone without talking to anyone in a personal way. I consume so much media, I go to movies alone, I go to music concerts alone, I go to comedy shows alone, I eat at restaurants, and go to cafes alone, I go do everything alone.

I've gone to therapy, and got medicated, and I've gotten involved in clubs that are my interests (ie. running, cycling), but everyone seems to have their friend groups that I can't seem to break into. I get that in the sports clubs I can't really because all the guys are literal semi-pros while I'm a casual amateur. But even one on one, I never get invited anywhere, and after being the one to invite people constantly, I feel tired and stop and then never hear back.  I get that in the sports ones I can't really because all the guys are literal semi-pros while I'm a casual amateur. I make them activity centered too (going on run, concerts, cycling) but I feel like I was the only one to invite them and never get introduced to anyone.

I constantly wonder what's wrong with me, why I haven't been able to make friends. I don't make friends easily. I had one friend in high school and I was the quiet nerd, weirdish, outsider kid up until end of freshman year college, where I've changed so much appearance wise and learned to communicate more, but still haven't been able to make friends.

  
I can talk about facts and experiences about rock bands, movies, comedy, gaming, books, running, cycling, pop culture, hiking, fashion, etc, forever because I spent so much time alone cultivating these interests. I'm neurodivergent, but I make sure its reciprocal and not monopolized and change topics if they're not showing interest. I'll do small talk and I'll ask people questions about themselves too (but not invasive questions). But I always feel like I'm overcompensating, most people don't seem to have these kinds of conversations.

I was thinking maybe:

\- its because I don't know how to banter with other guys. I have an easier time talking with women too. My dad wasn't really in my life, and the one friend I have from high school I've noticed we have very nerdy conversations about movies, tv shows, and cycling.

\- I don't know how to tell stories about my life

"Worried 5 classes is too much?","I‚Äôm starting an online medical coding certificate course at my community college in the fall.

"Kind of upset I can't go to the school I want to even if I do get in. What should I do though?","I'm currently a rising senior but I've already really looked into our financial situation and the aid I'm most likely gonna get and essentially the aid I'd get to UVA/VT (some of my top choices) would make the overall cost of attendance about 40k a year. This is not something we can realistically pay out of pocket as we already have a loan on our apartment. Additionally, me and my family want to have a life and money for traveling or just generally living comfortably which I think is reasonable. Additionally, I want to pursue my masters in Europe and maybe even move there so I don't want to graduate with debt.
Ive looked into a lot of other schools, including privates, and it's really looking like the financial aid will be about the same. I'm in a weird spot where it's like we are technically high income but can't pay that much money for uni.
Now my local school is GMU and I can commute to it everyday very easily. I will be saving 20k yearly by doing so. Its not a bad school by any means, but not a lot of people know about it and I heard the social life is kinda bad. Also not sure how good it is for my major because from what I've heard it's only known for cs.
Now personally I'd say I'm a decently competitive applicant. I've worked pretty hard academically, I've worked on my extracurriculars, and people say I could probably get into an ivy. Am I good enough to get a full ride to one of these schools just based on merit though? Probably not, especially because I'm not low income.
I don't really know how to describe this feeling. Don't get me wrong, I worked hard in high school because i enjoy learning and have a passion for the subjects I study, but i don't know if I'm gonna lose anything by not attending a ""prestigious"" university, and if I will, I'm never gonna know it.

There's other things where I'm often worried some people are less friendly toward me/don't like me for whatever reason, but overall this kind of thing is making me really anxious about going back and seeing those people again.

I'm a very sensitive person so it's probably not a big deal to most people, but these things affect me a lot emotionally. I also keep worrying that maybe that rumor has circulated over the summer, and I'm scared people are going to gang up on me or see me differently if they see me again. I didn't do anything wrong, but sometimes that doesn't matter when it comes to gossip.

"barely nontrad student seeking advice to return to college after long break","Hi. I'm a barely-nontraditional student (mid 20s) who's on a long gap year from of college due to issues beyond my control (health issues, domestic violence, university administration punishing me for my circumstances). I'm looking to transfer to a different university before my current one withdraws me from exceeding the maximum allowed leave time (2 years).

For context:

\- I have 5 semesters of college credit.

\- I have abusive parents whom I cut ties with during my gap year. I have documented proof of abuse. Because of my age, I will now qualify as an independent student for financial aid.

\- I have a 3.8ish overall gpa from a liberal arts college.

\- I was very burnt out during my 5th semester and wanted to withdraw but my university forced me to keep going (they threatened academic probation if I withdrew mid semester), which resulted in a low semester gpa (3.12 for 3 classes. tanked my gpa from near 4.0 to 3.8).

\- I don't feel I was productive during my break because it took me a year and a half recovering from domestic violence, stabilizing myself, and dealing with health issues. I did volunteer for a women's shelter for a few months and freelanced as a writer, but these things are completely unrelated to my major (which is in stem). How should I go about explaining this period without making myself look like ""high risk"" or a liability? Will this gap put me on a disadvantage?

\- What should I do to prepare for transfers?

\- If transfers don't work out and I end up dropping out of my current university, what can I do?

"don't sweat the small stuff during the upcoming application season","this is purely an anecdotal story but i hope upcoming applicants can be comforted by my experience.

i remember last fall during application season, i heavily altered the course rigor of my intended senior year schedule by dropping AP Physics E&M because of a horrible teacher to take Honors Physics and dropping AP Calc BC at my high school to take it online instead. that night, i spiralled and had a mini panic attack because i genuinely believed that i had ruined all my chances to get into a good school by lowering my course rigor. 

fast forward a few months after many painful rejections and waitlists, i got into Berkeley where i will be headed next month! 

i had an amazing teacher for Honors Physics (honestly my favorite out of all the teachers i ever had) while my friend still in AP Physics ranted every day in lunch about her teacher (he was the reason i dropped AP).

as for the online Calc BC, i never actually got around to finishing the course. i spent the months after getting into Berkeley worrying about the potential of being rescinded because i felt senioritis hard and kept procrastinating the course. after a vacation when summer started to Hawaii, i didn't feel any motivation to finish the course, so i decided to ask Berkeley if i could drop the course. they said my admission was sustained and dropped the transcript request the following day.

as a chronic overthinker and worrier, these small things felt like the end of the world to me at that time. but everything worked out in the end.

i mean sure, maybe i could've gotten into a ""better"" school *if* i had a better senior course rigor but a wise man named Max Verstappen once said ""if my mom had balls, she would be my dad.""

anyways, i am wishing all upcoming applicants good luck and please remember everything will work out in the end. maybe it won't feel like that during the months after decisions come out, but in the end, college will just be a small part of your journey.

"HOW TO CURE DEPRESSION GUIDE","(INTRO) 

I'm someone who used to have EXTREME depression. I hated being alive. I played video games from 10-12 hours a day (Not an exaggeration), had no real friends, was out of shape (fat, no muscle). The list goes on. 

Worst of all - I had no hope for the future 

The mindset you need to adopt to cure depression is this:

""Your life isn't bad because you're depressed, your depressed because your life is bad"". 

Some people think depression is a medical condition. Maybe it is, but following my guide will still make you happier anyway. So you have no excuses not to follow it, if you truly want to be happy. 


(PRACTICAL STEPS TO CURE DEPRESSION) 

1. Adopt the mentality that you are accountable for all the problems in your life, giving you the mental strength to overcome and fix them.

Don't blame anyone else. They aren't going to fix your life for you. 

2. Start exercising regularly, ideally 5+ times per week (gym, sports, martial arts etc.)

3. Read books for atleast 30 
minutes a day

4.Get on top of your work (studies, job, business etc.)

5. Meditate for 5-15 minutes a day to slowly clear your mind of distractions (starts off hard)

6. Improve your social skills and get more friends, and better relationships with your current friends and family

7. Limit phone, social media and video game usage to as low as possible, ideally less than 30 minutes per day

8. Become disinterested in politics and other aspects of life that you cannot change.

If you can't change them and thinking about them makes you stressed, then why think about them?

(EXTRA NOTES) 

1. The general theme here is that improving your life will give you a feeling of hope - knowing each day is slightly better than the last. How can you not be happy? 
 

2. It will probably take you a few months to see any significant improvements in your life. 

3. There will be ups and downs on your journey to cure depression

"Financial Realizations As An Adult","10 HARSH TRUTHS for Financial Freedom (No One Tells You)

1. Budgeting isn‚Äôt optional, it‚Äôs your GPS.
If you don‚Äôt tell your money where to go, it will disappear. Period.

2. Assets > Aesthetics. Flexing liabilities keeps you broke. Quiet wealth wins.

3. Marry someone with money values, not money problems. Wrong partner = lifelong poverty.

4. Debt is a modern-day trap. Pay it off. Then stay allergic to it.

5. Your brain prints your paycheck. Courses > Cars. Books > Bottles. Learn more to earn more.

6. Lifestyle creep is a silent killer. If your expenses rise with your income you‚Äôre not rich, you‚Äôre just treading water.

7. Audit your expenses like your life depends on it because it does. That $9.99/month? Add it up. That‚Äôs your freedom being sucked.

8. Invest before you feel ready. Even ‚Ç¨50/month gets you in the game. Time is your compound ally.

9. Be around thinkers, builders, and winners. Your circle is either your net worth or your downfall.
	
10. Multiple income streams aren‚Äôt a flex, they‚Äôre survival. One paycheck is too close to broke.

"Very sheltered almost 19","Hello anyone who sees this. I as i‚Äôve said in the title am almost 19 and i know nothing.

I‚Äôve been taught nothing my mother only tells me things when they are to be done right there and then. I know nothing about tax‚Äôs, insurance, anything really. I just want to be able to live decently if that‚Äôs all i can do. I wasn‚Äôt dealt a great hand and have been severely depressed for the past 6-7 years and everything went to shit. 

I‚Äôm working on trying to be a normal person but i kinda suck at it all. Never had a job. Barely showered or brushed my teeth for those 6 years and it‚Äôs bitten me in the ass given cavities and decay, and overall habit of not being overly hygienic. I don‚Äôt really know what i‚Äôm asking for but i guess just what anyone else‚Äôs lives and what they know and do that helps there future.

I am doing uni pre-reqs, on my path of becoming a nurse/midwife. So i‚Äôll have quite a lot of debt in HECS for a long time given i‚Äôm so far behind in the money department. I just really hate being an idiot and the people around me especially my mother who give me crap for not knowing something i should at my age. I‚Äôm very sheltered and isolated given the 6 years of living in house or when i did go to school. I‚Äôve been on my own for so long and told i would never amount to anything or be anything and i believed it. I truly believe it and i don‚Äôt care that much. I don‚Äôt understand anything at all.

I know getting a job should be easy but it hasn‚Äôt at all given everything around me isn‚Äôt hiring or want 2 years experience. If i had a job id have money, but i also don‚Äôt understand anything that comes with that. 

Sorry if none of this makes sense but im grasping at straws and any of the ‚Äòadults‚Äô around me don‚Äôt tell me anything or not enough.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mcbxbs/very_sheltered_almost_19/","1753796906.0","Adulting","JackfruitMotor4996"
"It‚Äôs my birthday today!","I don‚Äôt know if the context of what I‚Äôm going to say would matter to anyone, but for me it‚Äôs a big step to make. I was a person who is try so hard to be successful. I don‚Äôt know if I can make it but I still try and try until all left from me is nothing. I have a family of my own. When I started to become like this, I was a hopeless romantic person. I love, love. When I was young, that‚Äôs all matters to me. When I found the one, I shift to a different priority.

All this time, all I want to learn is to have someone I want to share with. I got brokenhearted and I experienced the pain of loving someone. I thought that‚Äôs the meaning of my life. I have to look for someone who will I share my life with. But there‚Äôs more to life. The life I never anticipated because I focused on myself in searching for the love of my life. In real life, love is just a feeling that everyone should feel and understand, but eventually once you achieved it‚Äîyou‚Äôll be on the next level. 

Living and surviving in this life is so crucial. I never thought that the next level is a lifetime crisis. I don‚Äôt want to be in this situation because for me it‚Äôs a never ending cycle. It‚Äôs a struggle that I never thought I will be in. When I was young, my parents would act as a normal parent. They never share that they have some struggles about how to live a life. They were struggling but because I‚Äôm just too young to understand. I never thought that they have problems that they never tell. I understand it now, they are surviving in a real world. They want a life for us and they want to separate us from the world they living in. I hate that we need to experience them all before we can realized that everything we do when we were a kid, is just an illusion of a real world.

Real world is cruel, I don‚Äôt want to invalidate those people who are having trouble living in their life when they are at school. We are living in a different world. In my world, I have to deal a different people who will kill you because you are incapable. I hate that we have to be living in a different world where we thought we are sharing the same timeline, sky and night. How we see our life defines how we see the life we have. 

It‚Äôs nice to be in a same space where everyone is equal and fair. But we know that life will never be fair. I hope everyone see this post as a sign and compare yourself, if you have only problems that can be resolved through communication‚Äî be outspoken and live life that you will not regret. If your problem is financial, which is one of my problem. Let‚Äôs be resourceful. There are many things in this world that we haven‚Äôt explore because we‚Äôre so scared of trying. Don‚Äôt worry, you are not alone. I‚Äôm still struggling. I hope we find our way. If it‚Äôs family problem, life is not easy but the way you think is right, is the best advice that you need to do. You are also scared. Go for it, and you will know it‚Äôs the right way. 

We have different and own problem, but we know what need to do. We are just so scared to accept that reality. We all know that we are the one who are making our problems, if we are the one who make those problems, we know also the solutions. 

I‚Äôm here because I want to release those thoughts in my mind. It‚Äôs my birthday but I want to share these thoughts. Thank you for listening. If there are errors with my grammar. It‚Äôs okay. No problem with me. Thank you for reading.

"Is this behaviour odd or am I just overthinking?","I [30F] moved to a different city with my husband 2 years ago. I am a kind of person who had amazing friends and I loved having my girl group around. In the new city, I became friends with his best friend's wife and the two of us got along pretty quickly. We are neighbors so we meet every other day and I thought we created a good bond over these years. Still, I notice that she keeps hiding random everyday things from me. 

For example, we often meet for post dinner walks and talk about by our days. Once she said life is boring and nothing is going on and then the next morning she is posting vacation pictures from a beach. I found it odd that she didn't mention it at all in during our walk previous night. 

This is just one of the examples and it keeps happening. I am used to friends who share their little excitements with each other and I find her behaviour extremely odd.

"Why do we use instant messaging instead of emails?","Sorry if this is little bit rant-y!

I know that this is not exclusive to Gen Z by any means, but I see it a lot more with Gen Z(Maybe because we were born into it.). I even saw Gen Z people avoiding using emails. For example, most of the students in my university don't check their emails, while instructors constantly post emails. They learn information in them by one of the peers checking it then spreading it via instant messaging(WhatsApp, in my country)! All of their inboxes are messy, filled with unsorted messages. None of them uses it to connect with anyone, even with the instructors who can only be contacted using it! Interestingly, this is the complete reverse when an instructor uses WhatsApp, they suddenly become active in there, for some reason I don't understand.

We, the Gen Z, always write short messages. So short that we are used to write our sentences in separate messages. Compared to older people's online conversations, where writing more than one line is not rare even on instant messaging. We don't try to write detailed shit anymore, even if we can write paragraphs about that topic. And we don't even try to write about multiple things in same conversation. Even worser, we sometime don't write and just send an emoji or a sticker and do nothing more.

Emails on other hand, can offer a much better way to communicate. It allows for complex threading, it promotes writing longer messages and write about more topics, it allows fluency in who sees which message by changeable ""to"" section instead of uncontrollable ""members"" system. We can  even save our messages locally while using emails! Sure, we can't do things like polls or creating groups, but, even before we could, we still used instant messaging.

So, why we don't use emails for simple communication in 2025 and simply prefer the instant messaging?

"How should I go about explaining my poor sophomore year GPA? [TW]","\[TW for discussions of abuse & mental health\] I'm in a really weird niche kind of situation with my stats right now and I'm stressing over it massively. Basically to put it short, sophomore year I was in a physically & mentally abusive relationship with a classmate who I had classes with leading me to fear coming to school. I also caught a severe case of the flu B due to the stress which led me to miss about another month of school. Due to the combination of circumstances I was dealing with I became extremely depressed and ended up in the ER a couple of times for suicidal ideation. As a result, my grades plummeted, and I went from a 3.1 to a 2.3 in a year. My school counselor is aware fully of the situation along with the SROs at my school, but me & my family decided not to press charges for personal reasons. I'm currently taking 8 classes on Acellus with a 4.0 UW gpa and I'm planning on taking 8 more the summer after my junior year. I'm about to go into junior year in a couple weeks and while I know that's kind of early for someone who's not planning on going to T20s to be stressing about college apps I'm really stressed on how it's going to affect my future. I know mental health isn't a valid extraneous circumstance, and due to my choice not to press charges I don't have any legal proof of what I'm saying and I don't want to come across like I'm over-exaggerating a breakup.

"Feel like my whole future's ruined.","I'm a computer science student, currently in my 3-year bachelor's program, which follows the French academic system. My average is around 90%, which I'm proud to maintain.

However, I need to mention that it took me three attempts to successfully complete my first year. This wasn't because I found the coursework difficult; it was simply due to neglecting my studies and relying on last-minute cramming. After about two years, I really focused and turned things around. Since then, I successfully passed my first year with approximately 90% in all courses. I've also just completed my second year of the program with a similar average, achieving between 90% and 95% in all subjects, and I'm committed to maintaining this performance for my senior year.

My main goal is to pursue graduate studies in France as an international student. My French language skills are also really strong, so I'm confident I'll do well on any required language tests for international students. However, I'm quite worried that this initial setback could significantly hurt my chances. So, I'm looking for an honest assessment of my prospects. It's worth noting that I have completed some strong projects directly related to the programs I'm planning to apply for, and they really demonstrate my understanding of the material.

"How do I stop replaying everything after being cheated on?","It‚Äôs been less than a week since I found out I was cheated on. I posted about it a few days ago when I was still in shock, but now the sadness and overthinking are taking over.

Every day feels like a loop. My mind constantly drifts back to the fact that he cheated. Even when I try to distract myself‚Äîlike watching Modern Family‚ÄîI get pulled back into it. I can focus when the episode is playing, but the second an ad pops up, I start drifting and thinking about everything again. Music does the same thing. It‚Äôs like every little quiet moment turns into a chance for my thoughts to spiral. I‚Äôm trying to move forward, but it feels impossible when everything reminds me of him.

The hardest part is realizing that the person I loved wasn‚Äôt even real. The man I thought I was with would never cheat on me, but clearly, that wasn‚Äôt who he truly was. And now I look back on so many conversations and realize there were red flags I brushed off. My brain won‚Äôt stop analyzing it all, and it‚Äôs driving me crazy.

"I feel like my time at university has made me more conservative; but not in the way you think","I feel like my time at university has made me more conservative; but not in the way you think

I started university 2 years ago, after spending 4 and a half years at cc. I did so because I took to heart the mindset of not taking out more loans than I could afford. My employer has a tuition assistance program but only gave me around 4200 dollars a year and anyone who goes to cc or university full time knows that 4200 would only cover a single semester if you were to take 12+ credits. So I only took 6 credits a semester and would only attend class in the Spring and Fall to exhaust what was allocated to me. 

Anyway, once I got to university I took on a full time class schedule where I had to take additional required diversity courses. As someone who's predominantly leftist I saw nothing wrong with this in theory but have always believed that DEI that was sought out would be felt more than DEI courses that were required of you if that makes sense. The talking point that Gen eds/DEI courses are there to ""well round"" your world view always felt hollow to me.

Well I took (and paid for) the required DEI courses thinking they were just stragglers from gen ed courses I overlooked but as i got further in my major I noticed more were required for my degree. 

This is where the conservative mindset comes in. 

I do believe that DEI courses are being shoved down university students' throats. What I don't think is, that it is bad for university students to be exposed to marginalized groups: their stories, and how systems in place have kept them artificially down. I do believe in systemic racism.

 What I do think though is that universities are hiding behind the guise of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in order to extract more money out of students who already can't afford university to begin with. So yes there is an agenda, a capitalist agenda being justified with faux-liberal talking points. Where I struggle is with the feeling of unfairness. Being in this situation is so demoralizing and it makes it hard to want to fight for a better future knowing I won't personally benefit from it. What's that quote people use a lot? ""Great men plant trees whose shade they'll never sit under?"" Or that conservative talking point when it comes to student loan forgiveness, ""I paid off my loans why shouldn't they do as well?"" I'm starting to have those type of feelings and am unsure how to remedy it. School has felt like a scam, I've felt exploited for a long time. 

TLDR:
I spent over 4 years at community college taking it slow to avoid debt, relying on my job‚Äôs limited tuition assistance. Once I transferred to university and started taking full-time classes, I noticed many required DEI courses‚Äînot just as gen eds, but as major requirements. While I support learning about marginalized groups and believe in systemic racism, I‚Äôve grown disillusioned with how universities seem to use DEI as a money-making tool under the guise of progressive values. It feels like exploitation, and it's made me question the fairness and worth of higher education, even though I still care about fighting for a better future.

"How I stopped losing 3+ hours daily to TikTok procrastination (built a solution)","**Background:** Junior CS major here. My biggest problem wasn't understanding material - it was the procrastination cycle that killed my productivity.

**The cycle:** Sit down to study ‚Üí feel overwhelmed ‚Üí ""just 5 minutes of TikTok"" ‚Üí look up and it's been 2 hours ‚Üí feel even more anxious ‚Üí repeat.

Sound familiar?

**What I tried that didn't work:**

* Deleting apps (reinstalled them same day)
* Screen time limits (easy to bypass when you're stressed)
* Study apps (too rigid, felt like punishment)

**The insight that changed everything:** Instead of fighting my brain's craving for bite-sized content during study breaks, I decided to redirect it toward actually useful stuff.

**My approach:** I built a short-form video app that only shows educational content in categories I choose. Think TikTok format, but for:

* Study techniques and productivity tips
* Career advice for my major
* Industry insights and networking
* Mental health and stress management
* or any other subjects you might wanna learn from that is helpfull

**Key features that solved my procrastination:**

* Videos are under 2 minutes (perfect for study breaks)
* Built-in time limits prevent endless scrolling
* Content filters so I only see relevant educational material
* No random drama or time-wasting content

**Results after 3 months:**

* Went from 3+ hours daily on social media to \~20 minutes on my app
* GPA improved from 3.1 to 3.6
* Actually applying study techniques I learn
* Feel energized after ""scrolling"" instead of drained

**The app:** It's called SmartScroll and it's in beta testing. I'm not trying to sell anything - just looking for feedback from other students who struggle with the same procrastination issues.

**If you're interested in trying it:** Comment below and I'll send you the beta link. Looking for honest feedback on whether this approach actually helps other students or if it's just me.

**Main question:** Has anyone else found ways to redirect their scrolling habits instead of just trying to eliminate them? What's worked for managing phone-based procrastination during college? and i am just generally asking for any helpfull advice on the idea and thinking that maybe it could also help any others with their struggles with procrastination.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mcj6sj/how_i_stopped_losing_3_hours_daily_to_tiktok/","1753813289.0","college","zakarialazaar"

"Moving Out & The Guilt Trip","So, I'm almost F27 (practically ancient, I know!) and finally making the leap to move out of my parents' place. This should be an exciting new chapter, and honestly, it *is* time. But I'm wrestling with some serious mixed emotions, and a lot of guilt.

For a while now, I've been helping my parents out financially. It wasn't ever a burden for me, and I was happy to do it. But now that I'm packing up and getting ready to go, I've noticed they seem really stressed about money. Like, visibly stressed. And that just guts me. I want them to be okay, to not have to worry, and seeing them like that makes me feel incredibly guilty for leaving.

On top of the financial worry, I'm already feeling the pangs of separation. My mom and I have these nightly conversations that I'm really going to miss. And my sister, who loves to just pop into my room and chat ‚Äì that's going to be a huge void too. It's making me genuinely upset to think about not having those daily interactions.

I'm trying my best to focus on the positive, on this new journey and the independence that comes with it. But this heavy feeling of guilt, coupled with the sadness of leaving my family, is really taking a toll. Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you cope with the guilt and the sadness of leaving your family, especially when you were a financial support? Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.

Context: I'm almost 27 and finally moving out of my parents' place. While it's time for this new journey, I'm feeling a lot of guilt because I've been helping them financially, and now they seem stressed about money. It also makes me sad to think about missing our nightly conversations with my mom and the chats with my sister. I'm trying to be excited for what's next, but these mixed emotions are making it tough.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mclc6l/moving_out_the_guilt_trip/","1753818105.0","Adulting","Vivid-Set3824"

"I don't know how I'll go back. No friends in college. TW: Suicide mention","I (21M) am at my wits end at my college. I'm planning to go on leave in the fall and probably for the whole year because last semester I almost failed out because of how lonely I was.

I have one year left but I'm dreading going back. Having no friends here has deteriorated my self esteem and mental health. I constantly feel like a loser and constantly feel like something's wrong with me for not being able to make friends. Sure, I'm not the most popular person, I don't dress that well, I don't follow sports, I'm not rich, and I have some quirks, but doesn't everyone? And when I visited my friends out of state, I had so much fun with them, and made new friends there. I also had one roommate who was a grade higher than me that I was friends with, and he'd invite me to things with his friends sometimes. Hell, I even made friends with some of my co-workers in their 30's at my job because we liked the same bands and movies.

I've done all the advice under the sun (about clubs and making friends), but I just don't think this school is right for me. I hate to blame the school, but the school is (and nothing wrong with it) frat cultured, business oriented, rich, doesn't have school spirit and most people keep to themselves here and seem very cliquey, while I'm more of a nerdy introverted type. I even listen to the conversations others will have  in the library or whatnot, and I know I can totally have those conversations.

I feel like I wasted my time in college. I missed out on high school cause of covid too, and I know it's probably not gonna happen but I'm afraid I won't be able to make friends in the future since people say college is the easiest. I spent 3 years here alone in miserable loneliness, and loneliness really does a number on your mental health. I've developed social anxiety, I spend hours a day now in bed doomscrolling, and I constantly ruminate on how I feel like I missed out. Each day felt so long too, and I got to the point where I had to move back home at the end of last semester because I was suicidal.

The worst part is I want to transfer, but I have a full ride here and I don't have the best gpa. I am medicated now and seeing a therapist. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1mclycg/i_dont_know_how_ill_go_back_no_friends_in_college/","1753819505.0","CollegeRant","Ok_Willow_5377"
"Feeling Lost at 40: Navigating Uncertainty in Career and Life","As an adult with a family, I‚Äôm really struggling right now with the uncertainty we‚Äôre all living through‚Äîespecially here in the U.S. when it comes to the job market. I moved to this country six years ago (I‚Äôm citizen now), and while I‚Äôm grateful for the journey, I now feel trapped in my current job. At the same time, I worry constantly that I could be part of the next round of layoffs.

That fear is hard to carry. I recently turned 40, and for the first time, I feel how fragile life can be. Since 2023, I‚Äôve applied to over 100 jobs. Despite a few interviews, nothing has moved forward. My current role is remote and relatively slow-paced, which gives me time for my family‚Äîsomething I truly value.

"Need genuine advice","I'm turning 27 on August 1st. I have successfully wasted the past 26 years of my life doing nothing. Every night I wish I could go back in time and did something. The constant regret is killing me. 

I have been an introvert all my life. I would rather sit in front of my pc playing games than going out. When I was 15, If I had a problem, I would just cry myself to sleep rather than doing anything. When I became 25, I resorted to drugs and alcohol to escape reality.For the past 2 years I have been addicted to weed. Now I know, I have to face my problems rather than running away.  But I think it's too late for me to turn my life around.

I don't like socializing. I have a few close friends. Never had a girlfriend. I'm not beautiful. If I see a girl I like, my mind goes,  'she will get a man better than me'. 

I have been jobless for almost a year now. I have spend all my money. Maxed out my credit card. I have like $10 left on my debit. My sim got cut, I have like $500 left to pay. I have to payback like $3000 to my friends which I borrowed. 

One thing I know for sure is that, even if my life gets worse than this, I would never consider suicide. I have a beautiful family. I cannot imagine them sad at my funeral. 

I quit smoking weed. I'm never gonna smoke it in my lifetime.

My mind is filled with thoughts everytime like what will happen or what have I done. I can't focus and enjoy the present. How do I overcome this?

I don't have big goals or anything. Get a decent pay job, help my family, find someone and live happily. I feel like I'm stuck in life. 

Thank you for reading all this and sorry for my english(its not my first language).  Any advice helps. :)

"Should I be fine?","Hello,

I am an incoming freshman at a T10 LAC and I received an email today along these lines-

‚ÄúHi ____

I hope you are having a nice summer. We have received your final transcript and, after reviewing, I'd like to discuss with you over the phone as soon as possible. Please select a time that you are available for a call from my calendar. 

All the best,‚Äù


I‚Äôm obviously not going to lie, I know why this is happening. I missed a ton of school 2nd semester senior year and got a lot of lackluster grades like multiple C‚Äôs. Now, I do have a reason for all the missed school, but idk if it‚Äôll be sufficient. Essentially my dad was officially diagnosed with diabetes around 2nd semester and a lot of our focus at home was towards catering to him. There was a certain night where he had a big health scare and ever since then we‚Äôve been very careful. A lot of my days off were spent driving him to appointments (he can drive he just prefers not to smh).  

I plan to explain this to the admissions officer in our call, and I was thinking I could even bring up academic probation as a solution, I‚Äôd be completely fine with them doing that for me to prove myself. 

Also, I was accepted into this school with a GPA already way below their average accepted GPA, so it makes my situation a lil iffy. First semester senior year I got all A‚Äôs, but through my other years of high school I had mid grades riddled within. My reason for those past low grades were due to me just being not locked-in frankly, and I‚Äôm hoping they understand that side of me isn‚Äôt coming back. 

Please let me know your thoughts, thanks so much.

"I think my mom hates me","Ok. I apologize if this is long. But I really cannot confide in any friends about this and I‚Äôm so scared to tell my husband because I don‚Äôt want him looking at the person involved differently. 

So I don‚Äôt wanna get into too much because my family has Reddit. But, here‚Äôs the story 
28F, married. I have a degree but just haven‚Äôt started working as yet. Spent the majority of my life being a student and a business owner. 
I don‚Äôt confirm to rules. I noticed this during my teenage years. For some reason, I impulsively be the exception. Now this hasn‚Äôt caused me harm in anyway but if you tell me that only 2+2 can equal to 4, I‚Äôll try my best to show you that 3+1 and even 4+0 can equal to 4. 
Now I don‚Äôt ever go out of my way trying to prove anything, but as long as I know I am right, I like to be heard. 

Now, I‚Äôm married and I love my husband and I‚Äôm confident that he loves me the same. It just so happens that I live 1.5 hours away from mom but I don‚Äôt like going home often because, I‚Äôm married now and I wanna spend time creating my own family and my own routine. 
I love my parents. They‚Äôve been married almost 40 years. 
Now, my mother seems to be against love for some reason. (I think it‚Äôs because my father cheated during their first 5 years and she never left but she holds it over him constantly) 

My husband is quite dependent on me and I love that. Not financially, but, to take care of him. I remind him to take meds, check ups, early beds, matching fits, the whole works. He‚Äôs calm and just enjoys spending time with me, which I always appreciate. 

Now, our finances, I control it. I lock money away for emergencies and savings and there has never been a day he asked for money and didn‚Äôt get it. 
But to get money to other savings accounts seems to be a hard task for the banks since they‚Äôre different banks in different locations and different names. So, I opt to send the cash to my mother to deposit to the bank closer to her and I use some of it for myself. Now knowing this too as well, I try not to be in debts or send too much and then I‚Äôll have to ask for it in return. 

Everytime I go to visit, my mother constantly embarrasses me. Asking me why am I poor and if my husband cant take care of me, or why I‚Äôm spending so much on him, and why I can‚Äôt spend money on her. Now I left my mother one of my businesses to run and I do not ask for any proceeds from it. It‚Äôs all for her and the upkeep of the house. Note, she has 3 other working kids who also share with her. But it‚Äôs always me. Whenever I try to do something to help me make money, it‚Äôs always an issue, or she‚Äôs against it. And now lately, because I prioritize my husband and his needs, she doesn‚Äôt seem to like it. She says things like ‚Äònever let a man know how much you love him‚Äô

I am his second wife. His first wife almost killed him and after she found out we were engaged, she tried to kill me too. 

But my issue with my mother. She never seems to understand and is bent on my husband providing for me 100% and me saving all my money and never sharing with him ever. My husband works 24-36-48 hours. There were days when I had to leave stuff prepped at home so he can just go in, get it and go again, days I had to meet him with new clothes and hygenics, days we almost got into accidents because we‚Äôre both tired but he asked me to keep his company, days and nights I slept alone, days I prepped my mind to see him in 3 days and it became 3 weeks. I love my husband and I‚Äôd do anything for him. 
Whenever I‚Äôm with my mother, I don‚Äôt socialize, but if he comes around, knowing the comfort we have by living together, again, I do anything for him. This had led to me borrowing money from my dad through my mother. Not I paid half of it back but I was waiting on my husband‚Äôs salary to repay the rest. However, the issues with the banks are still there. Unable to transfer. So now we have a joint account where the transfer would be easier but we would both have to be there to sign. My husband has to travel for the next year so we made the painful decision of giving up our apartment and me living at my mom and him at his until work for him is settled and we can go back to our own home. 
Again, I didn‚Äôt had to explain this to my mother but now, she wouldn‚Äôt even let me sleep in peace. 
She wakes me up at 3-4am to go house chores. Now again, I have no issues, but I‚Äôve only been with her for about two weeks. At my apartment , I‚Äôm up at 5 and I prepare stuff for my husband and go about my day and my body is scheduled to take a nap between 3/5 pm then I‚Äôm up till midnight. 5 hours is enough for me. 

She‚Äôs not trying to understand that and around 3/5 pm, she decided she now wants to take naps and doesn‚Äôt even sleep. She‚Äôs on her phone all the time. My body is reacting negatively to the change. My head hurts all the time, my skin is breaking out, diarrhea and I‚Äôm dehydrated. 
There is more but if I add, it compromises my identity. 
More to the point that, at 28, I‚Äôm still in tears crying to my dad and sometimes wondering if I can‚Äôt live without her because I know this isn‚Äôt fair. I feel sidelined every time I try to do something for my comfort or convenience. 
My mother never apologizes and whenever I‚Äôve made a point and everyone else in the house agrees with me, he go to line is ‚Äòthis is my house and what I say, goes‚Äô 

Do I talk to my husband about this? Do I talk to my best friend? Or do I just stay silent and plan my escape where I could very much never speak to her or never visit again for more than a few hours?","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mcospa/i_think_my_mom_hates_me/","1753826122.0","Adulting","Brief_Commercial4429"

"My summer course teacher won‚Äôt unlock assignments for me, even though others got help and it‚Äôs really hurting my grade.","Hi everyone, I really need to get this off my chest.

I‚Äôm currently taking a summer school course (English through **** summer school , A while ago, I got stuck because of a major issue with the Julius Caesar exam it took four full days to resolve. During that time, I couldn‚Äôt access any assignments, and my grade dropped from 63% to 47%. It really stressed me out.

Eventually, my teacher unlocked a couple of the assignments that were directly tied to the exam error, but now I‚Äôm finding out that other students are getting even more assignments unlocked assignments that were from previous weeks, not just the ones tied to delays or errors. I‚Äôve talked to a few classmates, and they said they never had the same long delay I did. Yet, they‚Äôre being given chances to finish and submit extra work that I‚Äôm not being allowed to do.

I feel like I‚Äôve been respectful in all my communication. I even explained that I was taking another course at a different school at the same time, and I‚Äôm really trying to balance everything. I told my teacher that I‚Äôm not asking for special treatment I‚Äôm just asking to be treated fairly. I was stuck longer than anyone else, and I‚Äôm the one who fell behind the most because of it.

My current grade is 62%, and my teacher said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not failing,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I was at 63% before I even finished the entire Fahrenheit 451 unit, the Julius Caesar exam, and the final exam. I know my grade would have gone up if things had gone normally. But now I feel stuck, and seeing others get help while I‚Äôm being denied is making me feel hopeless.

The teacher asked me to ‚Äúbe brave‚Äù and talk face-to-face over Zoom, but I honestly don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that. I just want to resolve this through writing. I‚Äôve already re-done an assignment that was unfairly flagged for AI, and I didn‚Äôt even know there was an issue with one quiz I wasn‚Äôt informed and got a zero without realizing it.

I don‚Äôt know what more I can do. I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt get the chance to bring my grade back up, and I feel like I‚Äôve been left behind when I needed help the most.

"Need advice on buying a new car?","I am reaching out for ‚Äúadulting‚Äù advice. With no Mother, Father, or Adult family assistance, I am here on this earth to get assistance from others. 

To start, I am 29yo and I want to purchase a new vehicle. Here‚Äôs the kicker: it will require a car note. No big deal right? Well I‚Äôll break it down: I currently own my car (2020 Kia Stinger GT) I love her, as it was a big purchase, that I was able to buy outright. She‚Äôs now 5-6 years old now and has been giving little issues. I had a recall on it & since then, there been issues here and there. I was told by a good friend to trade it in & get a new car to cut my loses. Only thing I‚Äôm worried about is having my car repo‚Äôd if I cannot afford payments. That would CRUSH me! Especially having owned my vehicle. 

Well, currently, I just got a good job WFH w/ decent pay, but before then, I was drowning in debt, struggling w/ meals to feed my family, and falling behind on bills. So w/ getting this job I am able to get back on my feet again. I am paying bills up, maintaining my car issues, paying fees that I ran into and getting back on my feet. Only thing is, I‚Äôm 7months pregnant and I‚Äôm due in late September. That means, I need to do all those things I owe and prepare for a new baby. Of course, I will take a 6 week leave of absence and come right back but if I were to purchase a car I‚Äôm scared of not being able to pay my note. 

My partner/kids Dad says he‚Äôs willing to help 100% w/ my vehicle payment but I‚Äôm still worried. I researched my KBB value and if I negotiate it good enough, it‚Äôll only take about 2k-3.5k to pay off. 

Soooooo my questions are:

1. Should I cut my loses and purchase a new car or spend big bucks repairing my vehicle
2. How do I negotiate a good deal and affordable monthly payments?

"I feel like a huge failure and liability to my parents, and I hate my parents for what they've done to me and what they haven't given me. Am I just ungrateful?","I‚Äôm a 21-year-old woman who graduated from college a year early this past May with a degree in computer science. It wasn‚Äôt the major I wanted, but my parents vehemently opposed my original goal of going into healthcare. I ended up attending a state college, giving up on a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù school due to the costs and distance. After my first year, I was forced to move back home and have lived there for the rest of my college experience.

As the youngest daughter in an Asian household, with an older brother, it feels impossible to have my voice respected or even heard. My parents‚Äô toxicity, along with the disappointment of not being able to create a natural distance from them during college, has left me emotionally unstable and depressed. I also feel like my college experience was stolen from me. I wasn't able to hang out with people on a whim, I couldn't even stay in a parking lot for more than 10 minutes before my dad texts me why. The jealousy I feel toward my brother only makes things worse‚Äîhe was able to leave at 18, attend college in another state, and now has everything paid for, including an apartment, medical school, and a new car, as well as an allowance.

My parents frequently boast about being ‚Äúwell-off‚Äù and in the ‚Äútop \_\_\_ percent,‚Äù and we live in a fairly large house in the suburbs. They constantly claim they treat my brother and me the same, and that they take pride in that. While both of us had 529 education accounts set up, mine fully covered my state tuition. For my brother, however, they paid out of pocket for some of his undergraduate tuition and all of his medical school tuition so far. They also bought him a new car for his medical rotations. My car, on the other hand, is technically a ‚Äúfamily car.‚Äù They use it constantly, shame me for keeping essentials inside, and criticize me for driving it ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù I needed my ""own car"" since I had to commute an hour every day for classes. My dad often takes my car to work instead of the other family car to ‚Äúsave money,‚Äù which leaves me trapped at home with my emotionally unstable and unreliable mother. This is because I am not allowed to touch the other car as it is more ""premium."" 

Lately, things have been getting worse. They treat me like I‚Äôm still a child‚Äîif not worse, like a second-class citizen. I get the cold shoulder unless they need something from me. When I make even a small mistake, like leaving plates out after cooking, an argument occurs, mostly focusing on how inadequate I am. My mother frequently calls me ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and claims I don‚Äôt do anything for the house whenever she gets angry. I try and defend myself now, by saying that it was a genuine mistake and that I can clean it up immediately. Mind you, I cleaned up most things, but always seem to forget one item out. My father undermines me constantly, even going as far as calling me a ‚Äúbad mother‚Äù to my 5-year-old baby boy(a corgi) if I don‚Äôt follow his exact schedule‚Äîlike waking up before 9am to take him out, or taking him out exactly as he planned--saying I am abusing him by not following a schedule every day. It's not that I am not following a schedule. I want to follow my own made schedule that works for me, not some senior citizen's. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been trying to focus more on myself lately. I‚Äôve started going out more, and I buy groceries so I can make my own meals.  But even then, I get criticized for spending money on groceries- yet they still use them without reimbursement. I have tried speaking out with logic in calm voices, or removing myself when they start escalating. They don‚Äôt acknowledge the possibility that I could be busy. When I stay in my room, they shame me for isolating myself, even though every interaction with them feels hostile and draining.

I‚Äôm currently taking an anatomy and physiology class- because my father doesn‚Äôt believe I can find a job in the time period he set for himself. I don't mind, since I love doing that kind of stuff. But what killed my enthusiasm was the conversation we had before I started it. I brought up the possibility of me finding a job before it ends, and he says it'll be a waste of money he was prepared for. I feel so much pressure to perform. Every argument ends with a ""if you're so unhappy, go get a job and move out"" as if I am choosing not to find a job right now. They also don't care that I am also taking an expedited class, sending out hundreds of job applications a week, while also self-studying for AWS certifications my father believes is essential and the key to finding a job.

One of my biggest emotional struggles is letting go, including when it comes to our house. I thought keeping it could help build generational wealth, especially if my parents were as financially stable as they claim. But I don‚Äôt really know our financial situation, since I‚Äôm never been told anything. I suspect they spent everything on my brother, leaving little left to help me escape. They insist they‚Äôve spent the same amount on both of us-just in different ‚Äúinvestments.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really have a support system. My friends are flaky, often offering false promises about letting me stay with them. My boyfriend and I are forbidden from seeing each other, and he isn‚Äôt even allowed out of his own house. I feel completely isolated.

Am I just being ungrateful, like they say? Am I a failure, as they constantly hint-despite saying they don‚Äôt think that? It‚Äôs hard to believe them when their actions say otherwise.

Honestly, I apologize for this word vomit. I could have it a lot worse. But I feel like I had my life stolen, all my potential as well because of the pain they have caused me.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mcrakm/i_feel_like_a_huge_failure_and_liability_to_my/","1753832493.0","college","PresentFirefighter66"

"University offered me a significantly higher scholarship by mistake, then retracted it after I committed Is their legal position valid?","Hi everyone, I‚Äôm an international transfer student currently dealing with a complicated financial aid issue at my prospective university.

Background:
	‚Ä¢	In late June, I received an official financial aid offer email showing a significantly higher scholarship amount (about $16,000 more than the initial offer).
	‚Ä¢	This updated amount was also reflected on the university‚Äôs financial aid portal.
	‚Ä¢	Based on this offer, I made a final decision to enroll, paid my deposit, and formally declined offers from other universities.

The problem:
After confirming the details, the financial aid office informed me that the higher amount was a ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù and reverted my aid to the original, lower amount. They apologized but claimed the updated offer was invalid due to a disclaimer stating that financial aid awards can change at any time ‚Äúwith or without the recipient‚Äôs consent.‚Äù

They also said my concerns had been ‚Äúescalated,‚Äù but have not provided any concrete information about:
	‚Ä¢	Who exactly the issue was escalated to
	‚Ä¢	Which department or individual made the final decision
	‚Ä¢	What criteria or process was used for that decision
	‚Ä¢	Any formal documentation of this decision

Their communication remains vague and lacks formal evidence of proper administrative review.

My perspective and concerns:
	1.	The financial aid dean or officer‚Äôs explanation seems inconsistent. Typically, such a serious issue would involve formal legal or upper administration review with documented decisions, not a vague ‚Äúescalation‚Äù followed by an informal email.
	2.	The disclaimer about financial aid changes does not negate the fact that I relied in good faith on an official offer and made irreversible decisions based on it, including forfeiting other university options and paying deposits.
	3.	From a legal standpoint, this situation resembles detrimental reliance or promissory estoppel, and I do not believe the disclaimer can fully absolve the university of responsibility.

Questions for the community:
	‚Ä¢	Legally speaking, am I correct in asserting my rights here?
	‚Ä¢	Can the university simply refuse to honor the scholarship after formally offering it, especially when I‚Äôve acted to my detriment?
	‚Ä¢	Does the standard ‚Äúfinancial aid may change without consent‚Äù clause hold up in such cases?
	‚Ä¢	What practical steps should I take next if I want to formally dispute this? (e.g., request formal documentation, escalate to university legal counsel, consider legal action)

I have saved all emails, screenshots, and portal records as proof of the official offer and its subsequent withdrawal.

If anyone has experienced similar issues or has expertise in university financial aid law or contract law, your advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

"36 hours until my Organic Chem final and I‚Äôm kinda cooked. Any advice appreciated?","Hi all. I‚Äôll keep this brief as I need to start studying.

My professor had a really ambiguous bit of text in our syllabus. Basically, a part of our grade average was listed in canvas under ‚Äúbonus‚Äù and was set up as an amount out of 0, so the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù feature boosted your grade average by like 8% when the full amount was input. (For context, this amount was for ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù in canvas but was listed under the ‚Äúbonus‚Äù category. Idk, it‚Äôs weird.) 

Despite being listed as ‚Äúbonus‚Äù it turns out that this part of the grade is actually under a different category. It is worth 75/75, not 75/0. This means that what I, and many others, thought was an eight point grade boost is actually only around one point. The professor fixed this error around an hour ago, less than 48 hours before the final, and announced that the previous weighting was inaccurate. 

Now, you don‚Äôt need to tell me that an 8% grade average boost is absolutely insane. I felt the same way, and had my suspicions, but the syllabus seemed to confirm it. Being a burnt out college student who has worked *tirelessly* to keep an A in organic, I was able to relax when the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù feature told me that I only needed to score a 25% on the ACS final to keep my A. Point blank, I haven‚Äôt been studying as much as I should. I‚Äôm tired and have allowed myself to relax. After the changes to canvas today, I need around a 75% on the final to keep my A.

I know a B isn‚Äôt the end of the world, trust me. But I feel really disappointed and stressed about it. I have truly worked my ass off for this class, and I honestly thought that I would be okay to relax a bit. All qualms aside with my professor, I‚Äôve decided to put all of my energy into studying to make the best grade that I can on the final; after all, what else can I do? Any advice on last minute studying appreciated!

"ACT scores","So I am in a slight dilemma regarding ACT scores, and I‚Äôm wondering what I should submit and if I should retake. I took it twice, first time blind school test and second time with a couple weeks of studying math. For reference I‚Äôm class of 26 applying as a biochem major on a premed track. 

1st score: 34 composite
- 33 science/math
- 34 reading
- 35 English

2nd score: 36 composite
- 31 science (not included)
- 35 math
- 36 reading/english

So my superscore is: 36 composite
- 33 science
- 35 math
- 36 reading/English

I‚Äôm very happy with my superscore, but for the colleges that don‚Äôt superscore (Harvard, UIUC, UW-Madison, although I‚Äôm already a direct admit) I‚Äôm worried that the 31 science will look bad.

So I‚Äôm wondering, is it worth it to retake? Would it really make a difference if I got my science a few points higher? If not, am I able to submit my superscore for all of the colleges I can, and then submit my 34 for the others? Or should I just submit my 36 w/ lower science for those schools?

Kinda bummed bc I did better on the science this time the curve just hurt me pretty bad and I‚Äôm not sure if could even do better if I did study.

I'm worried that if I just write that I wrote the paper, but I didn't publish it or win any award for it, then colleges will kind of look past it. I was looking into the Concord Review, but unfortunately their next deadline is August 1st which is too soon and my paper will more likely be ready in late-August or September. Is there any place similar to the Concord Review where I could submit the paper that has a slightly later deadline?

I'm willing to get a PhD, or multiple degrees. I'm willing to accept a pay starting around $55k-$60k (depending on the student debt I accumulate for this job‚Äì if it's a PhD, probably around $85k). I just need to keep my head above water, I'm not in it for the money.

"I‚Äôm losing motivation","So I‚Äôve made a couple posts on reddit already, but I haven‚Äôt been doing too hot. I‚Äôm a really ambitious student and I really want to get into a top college. But I was just talking with a friend today, after I had already gone and done my work for the day (just research stuff and another internship which I‚Äôm obviously grateful for having) and they were telling me about how they were just at home all day and naturally i ask why. They were studying for so many olympiads and doing a research project and this and that and whatnot. For the most part I think I‚Äôve been doing good, definitely better in my ecs than at school (my grades weren‚Äôt great this past year - sophomore year).

I know that to many people this will seem like an attention seeking post and that I‚Äôm just trying to get kind reassuring comments out of it, but genuinely I feel scared. Ik it seems extreme but just this past week I went to Chicago, and my parents being classic Indian parents pulled into UChicago and shoved me into the admissions office and told me to talk to them and ask questions. I know they have good intentions and the lady at the desk was incredibly nice but that kind of pressure has to be burdening for anyone.

I‚Äôve been trying to get back into some old interests and try to just better myself, even got a book and actually read because I wanted to for once, without it being a school assignment. But I‚Äôve had to give up so many things. I had to give up football just because it would‚Äôve taken up too much time, the three hour practices were a bit much yes but I genuinely liked it. I even stopped doing art, something I was actually skilled at and just can‚Äôt do that well anymore.

So going back to the main point of this post, I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I mean does college really matter, because I know I‚Äôd be fine at my local school but it‚Äôd be like letting down my parents since all they ever talk about is how much they sacrificed to bring us over the pond and going to a local school would just crush them, and I do love them a lot but it‚Äôs so much pressure.

Does anyone have any tips or some sort of success story or even a reality check for me. Anything is appreciated.

"Greetings from the other side (not in a weird way)","Hey all, I am a rising third-year undergraduate student and I just wanted to share my story to encourage those of you who are counting down the minutes until the Common App refreshes and the new admissions cycle begins. I was one of you three years ago. I filled out my personal things ahead of time, went through 8 or 10 drafts of a personal statement, and had a list of 9 schools to apply to lined up. My extracurriculars were mediocre (okay, fine, terrible - I kind of went into scared gopher mode after COVID hit my freshman year), but I was confident that with my good grades, excellent SAT score, and interesting story, I could get into my schools of choice. 

I applied to 9 schools. My top 3 all rejected me, and my 4th choice waitlisted me. The other 5 were mediocre: state schools or private schools that I didn't really want to go to. My main criterion was strong research, and the two private (and very expensive) schools that accepted me insisted that their research was strong, but it...wasn't. Kicking and screaming in my mind, I committed to my state school - my state school, that I had sworn up and down I would never deign to attend, that would have me living at home with my parents for another four years, that had notified me via text message of my acceptance, that had a >90% acceptance rate that included the majority of my vapid high school classmates. 

It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I am truly happy with where I ended up. I'm pursuing what I want to do, and have made connections with amazing people, both classmates and professors. I work in a lab (just like I always dreamed), do what I love, take classes that interest me, and pay far less than I would have at a private school of, frankly, lesser quality.

TL;DR: it may feel like college apps are the end-all-be-all, and that failing to get into your top school(s) is the end of the world.

"My brother stole from my college savings account","I am a first gen eldest daughter entering my sophomore year of college at a private school out of state. In my sophomore year of high school my mother passed away from health issues (2022) and had been out of work since Covid began. Due to my brother being the oldest he was in charge of handling the little she left us with the help of family friends. I was still in school mourning and had no concern or idea of how much and how the money was being handled. During that summer my dad started accusing my brother of taking a portion of the money (around 6k but because me and my sister were unaware of how much it was in total I‚Äôm sure he took more than that) and splurging it mostly on clothes over the course of the summer. My brother is into high fashion till this day is always buying designer pieces worth hundreds to over a thousand. I started to wonder where me and younger sisters portion of the money was. A few months pass by and I receive messages from the family friends who helped my brother in handling the money. Basically telling me that they stored me and my sisters money in a college savings plan that grew over time and that when I got into school I should let them know so they could give me access to it. My senior year I got into a private school out of state on full ride scholarship and since I come from a middle class family preparing for college was expensive. I needed money for new electoronics, clothes, dorm decor etc and the job I was working paid close to minimum wage. I decided to finally use the money from my savings account to fund the cost. When I tried to withdraw money from it I quickly found I would have to have the money sent to my brothers bank account and he would have to send it to me since he was the owner of the overall account. After I received that money I decided not to touch my savings account until sophomore year or incase of emergencies so the money can grow. Fast forward to this summer I have no job ( I did at one point but long story short my dad made me quit) and I have since felt there is no point trying to apply for a new one because it would take weeks if I got one and by the time school is about to start I would‚Äôve gotten 2 paychecks max. So I suddenly became jobless and have been depending on the only paycheck I got from the job before I quit. Knowing a new semester is approaching I planed to save up from my summer job to fund it but now I had no idea how I would without going broke. So I decided I would take from my college savings account it had been a full year since I last logged in ( mind you I also received a text message from one of the family friends asking if I had logged into it recently that she got a notification that someone was trying to change the password). I thought nothing of it and believed my brother was just checking something on it. Today I login excepting to see a minimum 5 or 6k because last time I checked I was at around 4k. I open my account to my surprise there is only $600 in it and I noticed my sisters was at $400. In my head I started to suspect it was my brother but I thought there is no way he would do that. I open to the transactions history and see several withdrawals made since May. I am in utter shock I immediately let my sister know and confront my brother. As I expected he starts playing dumb and lying that the money belongs to all of us. He tries justifying it saying it was ‚Äúhis mother‚Äôs‚Äù money as if she is not my mother also and it is no longer in her possession. My dad notices and call us to discuss the matter with him. He continues using the same reason that that was his mother and the money belonged to us all. Also my dad and mom got divorced years prior so he had no hand in dealing with the money and no idea how it was being handled. I tried explaining everything to him that the money was split between all 3 of us and he had spent his portion back in 2022. My brother then tried playing dumb realizing my dad remembered he had spent his portion that summer by saying oh he thought that since the money grows it would eventually come back that it was no big deal. He also started mentioning all the hardships he experienced from having health issues and not being able to work so he had no money to depend on. Whenever my brother would get new designer pieces or would spend money me and my sister would ask where he was getting money since he had not been able to work the past year. He would tell us he was receiving money from relatives or that we should mind our business. I of course found it suspicious how he always had money but I never would I have thought he was taking it from me. None of his justifications made sense because over the years he had that initial portion of my moms money, he worked 3 jobs and was receiving money from relatives but in order to afford his fashion lifestyle that was not enough and started taking from us. He also tried to lie and say he spent majority of the our moms money on paying off his student debt after he dropped out of college when our mom passed but like I said majority of it was used for personal wants and he was trying to use this point to show that he used the money for necessities and our portions were put in the saving accounts while he got nothing. Like I said my dad did not know in much detail how the money was spilt so my brother tried to manipulate the situation to seem like he didn‚Äôt get all of his portion and that all the money was just thrown together for us to use freely. After having to explain several times while trying to emotionally regulate myself my dad finally understood the whole story and told my brother he must pay back all the money he took. However he had revealed he had been taking from our accounts before this summer and I could only see the most recent transactions so I actually have no idea how much he spent in total I already know knowing my brother I am not getting back majority of that money and even the some he decides to pay back when he gets a job it will take him months and having to beg him which I do not have the energy for. What‚Äôs been done has happened and I am just so upset at the principal behind it and now I have no savings the remaining 600 will be going towards this upcoming semester and now I have to worry about how to save while being in college where the small grants I receive barley covers the semester. My brother loves to label me as being selfish after he does the most selfish things to take the heat off him but can never see the faults in himself. He‚Äôs able to do things like this to me that affect me in the long run with no second thought and would have continued if I never said anything. I find it so funny how family can be more cruel to you than others but because we are of the same blood I‚Äôm expected to move on and overlook all their flaws. I turned down a research opportunity and decided to stay home at least for freshman summer in hopes of spending time with my family because the next three years I most likely will stay on campus doing internships but I have simply been reminded why I choose out of state in the first place. I have a hard time processing when things happen to me I go into a state of shock and loss of what to do.

"A message to students who don't give a crap. from a drop out who actually cared but couldn't focus with your beyond stupidity in the classroom","I dropped out because I couldn‚Äôt handle the chaos in regular classrooms  or as I call them, daycares. Most of you didn‚Äôt give a damn about learning. You showed up just to screw around, disrupt everything, and waste time. Meanwhile, people like me, who actually cared, had to sit there and try to learn through your nonsense.

I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I genuinely wanted to do something with my life. I wanted to focus, succeed, and make school count. But instead, I got shoved into rooms where no one cared and the teachers were more like glorified babysitters. You didn‚Äôt want to be there, and you made sure no one else could do anything productive either.

I so wish I could‚Äôve handled the pace of AP or Honors classes not even for the bragging rights, but just so I wouldn‚Äôt have had to deal with all the tomfoolery. Those kids actually gave a shit from i heard from my lucky friends in AP/Honors. They had study groups. They worked together both unheard of in regualr classes. They weren‚Äôt perfect, but at least they tried. Why the hell can‚Äôt regular classes be more like that?! Why do we treat the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù kids like they deserve less structure, less discipline, and less respect?

So yeah  I dropped out. Not because I didn‚Äôt care, but because I couldn‚Äôt stand how broken the whole system was. The ones who gave a damn were the ones who got punished  trapped in chaos, ignored, and burned out.

"How Do IBroach the Topic to My Parents that I want to change colleges?","Hello! I don‚Äôt know if this is the right flair/tag for this, but here we go. (Also on mobile so sorry for weird formatting issues)

So, I‚Äôve (19F) already been through two colleges at this point (currently still enrolled in my second). But at this point, I‚Äôm considering dropping out and going to community college. There‚Äôs two reasons why.

1. Money. Yeah, yeah. I should‚Äôve really thought about it when I was in high school and shit. I regret going to a uni/college that has tuition fees.

2. I‚Äôve been doing poorly in academics. A lot of this is my fault (I‚Äôve been trying to rewire my study habits and going to the tutoring that‚Äôs offered, but I‚Äôm still barely making it). And I absolutely loathe how my current college grades us. It‚Äôs tests every other week and I feel like I know everything that feels relevant, but nothing that the professors think I should know.


I‚Äôve been having a lot of guilt over my decision. I feel like a financial burden towards my parents who‚Äôve basically wasted thousands of dollars and for what? Me barely passing classes with a ‚Äúyou tried?‚Äù star? Yeah, I hate the way that I feel like I‚Äôm a freeloading parasite.

I‚Äôm also starting to loathe college?? It‚Äôs been expected of me my entire life and how I felt pressured to go to college and live up to people‚Äôs expectations. Which probably isn‚Äôt healthy but I don‚Äôt know how to tackle that. Anyways, yeah. Maybe it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve had a lot of feelings of sadness whenever I see my grades slip, in comparison to how I did in high school (which is unfair and kind of entitled of me, since I know that high school and college are NOTHING similar to it).

But that‚Äôs besides the point. I need help trying to broach the topic with my parents. I feel like they‚Äôre going to ground me and basically (metaphorically) kill me when I‚Äôll ask them to swap colleges again. And I can already feel the disappointment coming. I don‚Äôt know - whenever I wanted to talk about it my throat just closes up and I just avoid my feelings and thoughts entirely.

Is there a way I can get to the topic? Should I ask one of my friends to be there for support? Or should I - I don‚Äôt know? Find a better solution?","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mcy4kb/how_do_ibroach_the_topic_to_my_parents_that_i/","1753852851.0","college","Sand-Bees"

"Crossroads post uni - what to do?","Hi everyone, I'm in my early 20s, just finished my IT degree, and I‚Äôm stuck between two very different paths right now and honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been working really hard to line myself up for a career in the government. I‚Äôve had a bunch of grad program interviews recently and things are looking promising. References are being contacted, so an offer might be coming soon. It‚Äôs everything I thought I wanted.

But last year I studied abroad and it completely changed how I see things. It was like I saw what life was truly about for the first time, like I was finally being myself. I loved the challenge, the culture, the freedom. Ever since I came back, I‚Äôve had this strong pull to go live abroad again. I just want to experience life fully while I‚Äôm still young and uncommitted.

I returned to my home country and started applying since that's what I thought the next step was at the time. It's taken between 3 and 6 months to hear back from some of these jobs, but in that time I've honestly had a change of heart. I want to live a bit more while I'm young. If my dream is to live abroad, why not chase it now? 

The thing is, I‚Äôm scared of walking away from the career path I‚Äôve spent years working toward. What if I don‚Äôt get another shot at it? I'm grateful for the interview experience and the opportunity to honestly leave what I feel like is a good impression on some of the agencies I only dreamed of getting an interview at. At the same time I feel like going down the graduate program path is sort of going down a path that someone else has designed for me and I feel like I'm just going through the motions. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? choosing between a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù job and chasing the dream of living abroad? Is there a way to balance both, or do you just have to pick and go all-in?

To make things worse, there was even a job that came up while I was overseas with the government. Honestly, it's my dream to work overseas at my country's embassy, and I'm kicking myself for not applying for it at the time. I think I could have got it but I passed because ""the money wasn't good."" Lesson learned I guess. 

I do think if I got into a program I could leverage that experience to eventually get my dream life abroad but I want to stop living for the future and start living my life now.

Would really appreciate any thoughts or stories. I‚Äôm just tired of overthinking everything and want to feel like I‚Äôm living my life again. Right now I feel like I'm just killing time and spinning wheels. I don't really feel in control of my own life.

"RMCAD - Need some answers or connections or somthing T-T","Hello!

So I'm (19) a recent AA graduate (2024) from a local community college, and I've been looking into different online schools that could help me pursue art as a career. My ultimate goal is to move to France and go into an art career there, but I don't particularly want to leave my family while sir preident orange is in office, so I have to wait until at least 2028.

I recently stumbled upon Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design and have gone mostly through the whole process of getting into the school other than paying for any classes yet. I have a school email, student ID, am working through the pre-orientation etc. I wasn't expecting to go so school at all this year but the idea of it is making me very excited because I really miss going to school and learning things and sharpening my abilities.

I talked with an admissions advisor and he told me a bunch of stuff about the school that I really like, such as their Alumni Association program, where you can take classes for free after completing your BA, you keep your student email so you always have access to those things (past schools have always deleted my email), and their illustration program has a path on childrens book illustation (which is the career that I want to go into). Another huge selling point for me is that the tuition is much cheaper than other federally acreddited art schools.

The last step in this whole process is just getting a cosigner for a loan but I really don't want to take out a loan even though it's a pretty small loan compared to some schools. I'm just worried that once I commit, it's over and I've made a huge mistake even though this school does look good to me so far.

I know that I could become a freelance illustrator without going to school, but I really want to go back to school and get my BA, and having a BA (according to my research) will definitely help me get a job or internship. 

I did a lot of research about this school before and the bad reviews didn't scare me, but looking at them now is making me freak out a bit and I don't even know what I'm doing anymore haha. 

Anyways, I guess it boils down to my questions being:

Am I being dumb and is this school bad?

Are there any other schools that you recommend?

Are the reviews true?

Should I pursue freelancing without going to school?

Are there any illustration companies that would possibly hire someone without a BA?

I'm just spiraling a bit and need some help or answers or just someone to say stfu. Anyways, if you read this, thank you, it means a lot to me. I'm just a scared little person trying to figure out how to chase my dream and I am terrified.

But now, I feel lost, i don't know what to do or how to be an adult or what responsibilities I should be taking on or what new things I should start doing.

I feel like I'm not a person yet and don't know how to do life. (Aftereffects of surviving depression) I'm just overwhelmed and disappointed at myself when all this time I thought I'd do better when the time comes and here I'm doing nothing, not knowing what to do.

Tldr: I feel lost being a new adult with time on my hands and not know what to do with myself. I don't know how to be pro-active with myself.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mda6ag/how_do_i_feel_adult_and_ready_to_be_my_own_person/","1753890585.0","Adulting","not-your-cunt"

"Let‚Äôs talk about phone bans","
So hello. I just wanted to talk to you all about the phone ban/restriction issue I‚Äôve been seeing lately. As someone who grew up in a British school system in another country, which had strict phone bans and switched to the American system here, which had similarly strict bans here‚Äôs what I think about this rising topic.

My take. Grow up, I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt handle 8 hours of the 24 hour time period 
being without your phone in a learning scene where you aren‚Äôt getting constant hits of dopamine. So quit whining man. I‚Äôm sick of this protest business and people saying it should be allowed during lunch. NO it should not, 

you know why? 

Because no one is gonna talk to anyone, it‚Äôs just going to be a room filled with the echoes of apps.

And please, don‚Äôt tell me about

‚ÄúbUt I UsE it ProDucTively and play instruments or write stories or do work‚Äù.

Well good news for you my brothers and sisters, you can do all this in *drumroll* 

The REAL LIFE WORLD üò±ü§Ø

And the reason why the people who actually used it for the right reasons can‚Äôt anymore is because of your peers who can‚Äôt control themselves.

Heck I‚Äôm supposed to be the one agreeing with keeping phones because it‚Äôs an invention targeted towards are age group, but as a person who used to be glued to my phone, realized that this was unhealthy both mentally and psychologically, and CHOSE to steer clear of it, I‚Äôve seen the negative impacts. 

I got rude I got agitated, my grades were fine cause my parents were on my case, but I felt more sad, my head was in pain 24/7 and yet I wanted more.¬†This was NOT the person I wanted to become, I was a zombie. 

Here I am on Reddit using the very thing I‚Äôm against, but you know what‚Äôs changed, I‚Äôm happy, I go outside more often to practice sports, I take jogs in my neighborhood, I actually learned stuff this summer rather than doomscrolling all the time. And best of all, my screen time is on average 5 hours or less. (Note some of that time is for studying). It may not seem impressive to one, but it is to me. And my mental health is at the best it‚Äôs been in a while.

So no, no I do not want these phones in our schools, because we opened the Pandora‚Äôs box the moment we used them. I want people to socialize, to learn, (MORE), and I don‚Äôt want to seem like that one kid who says this but I hope more people agree. 

Not that my school experienced the phone addiction rise but I‚Äôve seen its effects on people like me, on kids like me, because big corps don‚Äôt give two hoots on whose child suffers, they just want quick cash, and we need to understand that if it‚Äôs not clocking to you. (See what I did there).

AND before you dopamine hungry gollum‚Äôs crawl after me talking about the people who have specific needs like diabetes that require regulations, there are exceptions to that, there are laws in schools for that, and if there isn‚Äôt, bring it up to the board cause that must be illegal.


Now it‚Äôs time to ask you why phones shouldn‚Äôt be restricted/banned in schools to those who believe this. I want to hear from the people in Texas who have this as a state law especially.

No I do not want any of these excuses

‚ÄúMy parents want to call me or text me if I‚Äôm okay all the time‚Äù 

One, it sounds like a them problem
Two, this is most likely a lie and you‚Äôre the very person who scrolls on TikTok mid class
Three, talk to them because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre paying tens of thousands of dollars for you to be in your phone in school.

Intrigue me, help me understand why this shouldn‚Äôt be the case, why we should let these devices in a learning environment?

I genuinely want to hear you out because I‚Äôm not some geezer or sheltered kid whose never heard of a tiny glowing box, I‚Äôm someone whose experienced both the good and bad of phones and I believe that the bad far exceeds the good. Phones are quite literally DESIGNED to be addicting and if you don‚Äôt see that, God help you because you may be too far gone mate.

Oh! and to the people who say school has gotten worse since the bans‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ well I hate to break it to you but there‚Äôs this term called WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS and being forced to be away from the dopamine box and be stuck in school for 8 hours to LEARN (scary right?!) in a building full of like-minded consumers is really something lmao. 

Anyways that‚Äôs all for now. I would LOVE to debate this with you.

"Should I apply ED to Cornell to take advantage of legacy?","Hello reddit, this is my first post here so apologies if I get some formatting or sub meta-rules wrong.

I'm a 17M relatively competitive prospective student, and I've been especially looking at Cornell recently (I would be attending fall '26). I took a tour of their campus yesterday, and that seemed to make me fall in love with the school even more. I can absolutely see myself as a student there and I would love to go there.

I've been thinking a lot recently on ED and if it's worth it to ED at Cornell or just apply regular decision. After my trip, I think Cornell is officially my #1 school, so I'm not worried about getting into a ""better"" school and not being able to go. 

However, financial aid is a slight worry for me. My family is decently well off (upper middle class), but I'm the oldest of 3 who all plan to go to college. My mom was worried about me applying ED anywhere, citing that any school I'm committed too i.e Cornell could see my siblings' savings and refuse to give the financial aid I need since I could always use their money to attend school.

On the other hand, considering I have a parent who went to Cornell, I have heard that Cornell is a lot more likely to consider legacy in the ED stage, and I don't want to ""waste"" this opportunity. In addition, I feel like ED could show Cornell the interest I have in their specific school in a way RD couldn't do.

So, what do you guys think? There was no informational session when I visited yesterday (I planned to directly ask an admissions officer or the like a simplified version of this question). Should I apply early decision?

Let me know if there's any other useful information I should provide.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mdcagn/should_i_apply_ed_to_cornell_to_take_advantage_of/","1753895365.0","ApplyingToCollege","Arietem_Taurum"

"A little over a year ago, my life was just alcohol, drugs, and Emptiness","My life was mediocre at best, I was a relatively good student, pretty introverted, my dad left us when I was 7 so I grew up with my mom which was abusive and had some serious anger problems which let me to leave home as soon as I turned 18; I moved to a new city, renting a small room and started studying. In those moments i wasnt really unhappy it felt fine, life was okay; After I finished my bachelor I started working at a IT company near my hometown. 

The problems arised as soon as COVID hit; probably everyone is familiar with the mass unemployments in that time approximately 7 months after i started working there I was laid off; Due to not being able to pay the rent anymore I decided to move back to my mom again; that was when I was 21; The situation between me and my mother, still was pretty bad, we had many arguments over stupid stuff and one evening she told me how miserable I am and that I was the reason that my dad left us‚Ä¶ that hit‚Ä¶ hard, really fucking hard. She was intoxicated that evening but I had the feeling that she was lying about it, she looked so dead serious and angry. 

That evening broke me so hard. I went trough a lot of shit in school, kids picking on me, in highschool most people avoided me. But hearing something like that from your own mother really felt like my heart completely shattered. So I decided to move out‚Ä¶ again. 

Luckily I had made a friend at college that let me stay at his place I promised him that I would pay the rent back as soon as I found a job again. He turned into my best friend, I love him so much but he really liked to drink, drink a lot; months and months onwards we spent the evenings drinking and playing games - honestly it felt really good in that moment - the numbing of the past, just enjoying the present. But you probably know what happened‚Ä¶ I turned into an alcoholic. Let me tell you one thing don¬¥t ever try to numb your pain with substances, in the end the pain is much worse.

I spiraled down into a fucking depression. My life only consisted about doing drugs all day, drinking, watching porn and gaming. I hated myself‚Ä¶ i hated everything about life. 

One evening the 21st of February 2024 I took psychedelics and I just busted into tears. It opened my fucking eyes clearer than ever. 
My life was miserable I was miserable, I didnt want to continue living in this shitty life. 
So I went to the fridge grabbed every fucking bottle of alcohol and poured them into the toilet and threw all the drugs in the trash. I went outside and ran fucking 7 miles in the dark.  When I returned at my buddy¬¥s place he was super fucking pissed and screamed at me, which triggered my past memories with my mom and I fucking cried like a little child in front of him‚Ä¶ We talked for a long time and decided we needed to change. I was sure if we had continued living like this we¬¥d either ended dead or homeless. The next day we cleaned the whole house threw away every last drop of alcohol and substances.

The first few weeks were tough super fucking tough. It¬¥s even harder when both of you were addicts.

We both started journaling every morning and evening. Read through all the past day notes from the day before. Reminded each other every day that why we¬¥re doing. I visualized it every freaking day on how my life will look like. We decided to hit the gym, run every day, get the mind running in the direction we wanted our lifes to look like. 

I tracked everything. That gave me so much more motivation to push trough. Honestly it¬¥s quite insane how my life looked back then when I think back and read trough my notes. It took a while but after around 7 months, October last year, I started having a job again at an IT company again; My life literally made an 180, after years of sadness, bullying and just mental warfare I¬¥m finally free; my mind is still hurt but I¬¥m nowhere near on how it was then. 

I spent 592hours since the start of February 2025 to improve my life further, did a lot of therapy, found a wonderful woman at my workplace. Read tons of books on self improvement, did nofap for several months and made some new friends. Still drug and alcohol free. Still training and running. 

Every one of you has so much potential. Never give up on yoursef. You¬¥re capable of so much more than you can ever imagine. Everyone has different stories and backgrounds, for some changes might be easier and for some a lot harder. But remember everyone has the right to be happy! But also the only person who¬¥s truely able to change your life is the one reading this text. Love yourself.

**me:** wasian female, queer, from CO, US/CA dual citizen. \~175k/year family income, parents willing to help pay. eventually planning on law school.

**intended major:** poli sci or public policy. would not be adverse to dual majoring in enviro sci. second-choice majors are IR, sociology, and linguistics.

**location/setting:** preferably on the west coast or northeastern US, but this isn't essential. very open to canadian schools. would like to be preferably in an urban setting or near a city, but i'll be fine as long as i'm not in the middle of nowhere. would not like to be in a solid red state.

**campus:** distinct or somewhat distinct with a decent amount of things to do. decently community-centered. size doesn't matter too much to me. politically progressive or moderate overall and not overtly religious.

**cost:** i'll consider this after applying once i get aid packages and scholarships.

**current list:** parents making me apply to HYPSM + all other ivies but columbia. UW madison, UW seattle, mcgill, UBC, UCSD, occidental, CU denver, CU boulder, colorado state. on the fence about BU, lehigh, UCLA, american, and washU. been told to consider various LACs, george washington, and GWU.

**other:** i have a pretty big crush on mcgill. toured the school and absolutely loved the aspects of campus and student life i previewed, and montreal is one of my favorite cities. despite being literally in downtown montreal, it still felt campus-y around mctavish. only thing i wasn't a fan of is that the social life is more centered around montreal than the school itself, but i loved montreal and the student body seemed super nice, so i'm not too worried. i like yale too, i've been told by a few people that it's pretty artsy and laid-back for an ivy league school, and it seems like they have a strong campus culture.

**basic stats:** 4.0UW 4.61W, projected salutatorian. 4/6 APS (others are comp sci) + 1 self-studied AP. 5s on all aps i've taken so far. 1500 SAT (770 eng 730 math) but retaking.

"Feeling Lost: Navigating Debt, Family Expectations, and Future Dreams","I'm feeling incredibly lost and overwhelmed by my current life situation, and I'm really looking for some thoughts and advice on where to even begin.
Right now, I'm in a job that, while poorly paid, offers me a lot of freedom and downtime. The trade-off, however, is that a significant portion of my income‚Äîaround 60-70%‚Äîgoes straight towards debt repayments and direct debits, leaving very little for essentials like food and travel.
I'm still living at home with my parents, and I contribute financially to help them out each month. This arrangement has become far more complex recently, as my father, who was the primary breadwinner, hasn't secured a job in a while, and my parents are now struggling immensely.
This has led to a really difficult proposition: my parents want me to take out a personal loan to cover their bills. The plan is for them to repay it once the house is remortgaged, and they also want me to be added to the deed at that point. My mother has even claimed she'll help with the loan repayments until the remortgage goes through.
Honestly, I can't really afford to move out and live independently right now. But at the same time, I'm unsure if I'm ready to be tied to a mortgage for a house that would be shared not just with my parents, but also my younger siblings. My biggest concern is that my credit score isn't even good enough for me to qualify for a mortgage.
Adding another layer to all of this, I'm actively working on building my design business on the side. My hope has always been that this would eventually become my main source of income and allow me to gain financial independence.
I feel like I've somehow messed up with all this accumulating debt, to the point where I can't escape the trap of living at home and financially supporting my parents. My original understanding was that my parents had their housing sorted, and I'd just continue to contribute monthly while focusing on clearing my own debt. I never anticipated having to take over their mortgage or taking out loans on their behalf.

‚ÄúCan we just lie down and exist together for a bit?‚Äù


Adult relationships aren‚Äôt about constant butterflies. They‚Äôre about consistency during chaos.
About showing up even when you‚Äôre drained, mentally or emotionally.
About not giving up on each other when life is throwing stuff at both of you from all directions.

Sometimes we‚Äôre not even fighting. We‚Äôre just overwhelmed. Work. Bills. Health. Family. Mental burnout.
And in the middle of that, you‚Äôre supposed to nurture love too?

That‚Äôs what makes adult relationships hard.
It‚Äôs not the lack of love.
It‚Äôs the lack of time, energy, emotional bandwidth.

And yet, the most beautiful thing?
When both of you still try. Even if it‚Äôs clumsy. Even if it‚Äôs not perfect.

Just two tired people choosing each other over and over again.

That‚Äôs real love in adulthood.

My phone is overloaded with reminders for everything, even the simplest things, because I‚Äôm constantly scared of forgetting something important. 

What makes it worse is that I often feel surrounded by negative people and can‚Äôt distance myself from them. My school environment is super depressing, and despite being ranked in the top 1% of my class, this past freshman year felt like the most emotionally draining one I‚Äôve ever had. I constantly felt isolated, unnoticed by students and teachers, and like I didn‚Äôt belong. 

Socializing has always been difficult for me, and sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I experience a tingling sensation all over my body. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been stuck in a state of dissociation at school. I know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way, right?

"Fuck ups in presentation","I had been preparing for the past two weeks for a technical presentation at my company‚Äîputting together a solid action plan, working through a detailed demo, and getting all layers of the software ready to showcase. Today was the big day. My manager asked me to present in the conference room and also stream it via Teams so remote colleagues could join.

Unfortunately, the internet connection was only around 3 Mbps, with a frustrating latency of 20‚Äì30 seconds. As a result, I was only able to cover about 30% of what I had planned and envisioned. I‚Äôm feeling disappointed and frustrate, the outcome fell far short of what I hoped for. While I was able to communicate the core idea, the overall impact wasn‚Äôt what I intended, and it‚Äôs left me feeling deeply unsettled.


I definitely sensed some strange looks from a few colleagues, and honestly, I feel terrible about how things turned out. It‚Äôs really discouraging‚Äîafter putting in so much effort, it‚Äôs hard not to feel embarrassed. I was genuinely excited to deliver something meaningful, and to have it derailed by technical issues felt like all that work went to waste. It‚Äôs tough to even think about showing up to work right now because it feels like the whole experience left a negative impression.

"Investing for my kids future question","Okay so let me just start by saying that I come from 2 immigrant parents who were very resourceful and hard working but not financially literate. I do not blame them at all, not their fault that I'm not good with money. 

I have 2 kids (4 and 9) and I do not have a college savings account, and I'm a little worried I don't want them to turn 18 and struggle paying their bills and mine at the same time. I plan to fully fund college if that is what the choose. My wife and I own our home witch should be paid off in the next 12 years or so and we both have a 401k that we contribute 6% each (company matches up to 6 so that's 12%? Not sure.) I looked into the college savings account and currently we can only afford to put away an extra $200 a month away after our experiences and our little savings that we put aside for emergencies.

Instead of investing into a college savings account, I wanted to know what opinions y'all have on investing that into BTC and ETH for the next 15 years. I feel like it would pay off better then any college account could ever. And if that doesn't work out then I'll sell my house or whatever I need to do.

"What to do with my guinea pigs?","I have 4 guinea pigs at home and I treat them like my babies. I can‚Äôt imagine abandoning them for college, but I can‚Äôt take them with me. I don‚Äôt want to give them to someone else. I‚Äôm the only mother they‚Äôve ever known and nobody will treat them as well as I have. How could they possibly adapt to a less loving home, when I‚Äôve taken care of them for years already?

I‚Äôm a junior in high school and starting to think about college. I wanna go somewhere close to home so maybe, on the weekends, I can visit my guinea pigs and do the cleanup work. My mom could feed them, let them out and do the easy work during the week. 

Or are there people I could find that are seriously willing to give them a great life, lots of space to roam around, and do frequent cleanup work? I just doubt that. 

Do I even have to leave home for college?

I know I shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice my future opportunities for guinea pigs, and I‚Äôm not planning on it, but if I go off to college without knowing how my guinea pigs are doing, that uncertainty is gonna give me severe psychological pain and anxiety.

So what are my options to ensure my guinea pigs can keep living a loving life at home?

"I feel stuck at the start of adulthood. How do I learn to grow up when I feel I missed the basics?","I‚Äôm 18M, turning 19 soon. I finished high school a year ago and have been stuck since (studying for college entrance exams, unsure if the major I chose even makes sense anymore). I don‚Äôt know know in which direction to go.

Beyond school, I never learned how to really function. I can‚Äôt drive. I don‚Äôt know how to handle appointments, repairs, errands, or even basic conversations without overthinking everything. I fear small things (calling a doctor, asking a question, making a decision) and I hate that. 

Some of this is on my upbringing. My parents helped with everything but taught me little. They flip between babysitting me and expecting me to act like a ""manly man"", with no in between. Talking to them feels like trying to fix a computer with a hammer‚Äî bittersweet comments, denial, confusion. I try to explain how stuck I feel, and I get weird praise or vague reassurances. Nothing ever changes.

But I know I played a part. I was the ‚Äúgifted kid,‚Äù praised for being smart, so I leaned on that. If something was boring or outside my confort zone, I‚Äôd avoid it. I thought it didn‚Äôt matter-until now. I‚Äôm behind, and that's pretty painful to admit it.

Even academically, I‚Äôm not doing that great (earlier struggles in certain subjects are now catching up to me). I‚Äôve tried to manage the anxiety by burying it, distracting myself, or just hoping it would fade. It doesn‚Äôt.

Realizing all of this this late hit me like a truck. Most people my age seem to have at least some support system or sense of direction. I feel like I‚Äôve lost parts of myself. I used to be the smart, helpful, confident and idealistic one. Now I can barely help myself. I‚Äôve become anxious, withdrawn, and even developed a stutter I can‚Äôt control. 

I‚Äôve tried opening up to friends, but it didn‚Äôt help. If anything, I feel like I‚Äôve become more irritating to them, like I‚Äôm just tiring people out instead of connecting.

 I keep feeling nostalgic for when things were simpler‚Äîwhen I felt more capable, more hopeful‚Äîbut I know I can‚Äôt just go back. I don‚Äôt want comfort, I want direction.

"Advice needed to be a better adult and roommate","Hi, Reddit, I‚Äôm posting here because I want to be better at adulting, and by proxy, be a better roommate.

Before I say anything, a bit of context about myself, I (26) grew up in a messy and chaotic household, so I‚Äôm acclimated to mess more than the average person, and as an adult, I struggle with executive dysfunction and ADHD. I moved out at 21 because my living situation got too terrible to handle, and I thought I would be much better at adulting by now, but I‚Äôm struggling. This doesn‚Äôt excuse my ‚Äúcrimes,‚Äù haha, but I hope explains where I‚Äôm coming from.

My roommate (29) and I have had our fair share of tiffs in the past; he‚Äôs a pretty clean and methodical person, and doesn‚Äôt own much. I‚Äôve gotten better at doing certain things to his standards to minimize conflict, like washing dishes immediately after cooking rather than waiting until later.

But there are some other things I want to get better at, and it‚Äôs like my brain fights me on anything that involves being an adult.

Around the house, I‚Äôm really struggling with tidiness. Specifically clutter. I don‚Äôt leave trash around, but I have a bad habit of leaving behind my books, notebooks, cords, etc. in communal spaces like on the coffee table or dining table. And, frustratingly, if it gets moved into my room, it just becomes clutter in there, until I rally myself to clean up once a month.

I am taking medications, but I‚Äôm currently stuck in a feedback loop where I forget to take my meds, which causes me to become more depressed/dysfunctional, and makes me forget to take my meds more.

I‚Äôm want badly to be a better roommate and adult. How do I combat this ‚Äúclutter blindness‚Äù and executive dysfunction? I‚Äôve tried every tip in the book: setting timers, writing reminders, having organizer bins, etc., and it all makes me want to pull my hair out or outright doesn‚Äôt work. (Don‚Äôt underestimate my ability to ignore a phone alarm, despite my best efforts.)

Please be kind, help and advice appreciated from others who struggled with this.

"Is 29 to late","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm just looking to get some perspective or others peoples stories. 

I‚Äôve had a hard time dealing with various addictions in my life. I was able to overcome a pretty bad cocaine addiction when I was in my early 20‚Äôs, I was doing it constantly for 2-3 years. Since then I went to school and became a nurse. However, the past year and a half I have been dealing with a gambling addiction. I lost all my savings of about 55k. I feel pretty defeated at the moment but I‚Äôm trying to keep my head up. I‚Äôm confident I will be able to put this in my past like I have with other things and I just want to solely focus on building my life up and being happy. 

I was also self harming a lot in the past and was really depressed- growing up was difficult, my parents had a really bad marriage and my mom would hurt herself a lot and constantly talk about killing herself, I always tried to be there for her but it definitely had an affect on me. I didn‚Äôt have a very good relationship with my dad either as she told me he was assaulting her when I was pretty young. When I think back on my childhood I don‚Äôt have a lot of good memories and I spent a lot of time being angry. But the past couple years Ive stopped completely self harming and put all that energy into health and fitness. I‚Äôm really hoping the gambling is the last issue to work out before I can start living the life I want. 

It‚Äôs hard not to feel like I‚Äôve wasted my 20‚Äôs though as I‚Äôll be turning 29 later this August and I don‚Äôt really have much to show for it
and sometimes I just feel like a failure. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else had similar experiences? Thanks a lot!

"Feeling a bit down about commuting","I‚Äôm about to start my first year of college, but I will be considered a junior since I graduated from high school with my associate‚Äôs. I will probably be in college for 3 more years though since I really only have about 25% of the requirements for my major. I feel like I should be happy because I‚Äôll be done with college sooner, but now I‚Äôm realizing just how much I‚Äôm dreading my decision to commute. 

Financially, it was the best choice. I will receive enough money back in a refund that will allow me to purchase a new laptop and any other supplies I might need this semester. Unless my financial situation changes, I won‚Äôt have to take out any loans while I‚Äôm at this campus. 

However, it feels like it was a terrible choice for my mental health. I will be relying on my mom to drive me to and from school since my family only has two cars (one other for my dad) and my mom needs it to get to work. I wasn‚Äôt able to get a job over the summer to buy myself a car after one of my parent‚Äôs cars was totaled in an accident a few months back and until my parents recently bought another car to replace it, my dad was using the remaining car all day. There is no public transportation anywhere near me either, so I had no way to get around (I live in a rural area with nothing but farmland for miles).

On top of that, the campus I will be attending is not the main campus but a branch campus. It‚Äôs a decently sized building but that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs pretty much no social life there. I‚Äôm not sure they even have any clubs. I can‚Äôt commute to the main campus because it‚Äôs 2+ hours away. 

I made this decision despite these drawbacks because I knew I would‚Äôve had to take out loans to afford going to the main campus. I‚Äôm first-gen and low-income, so I was terrified of taking on any significant debt. And with our car issues, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to work to offset the costs. 

I don‚Äôt think there was much I could‚Äôve done, but I‚Äôm still sad at the lack of independence I will have. I‚Äôve been 18 for 6 months, but I have as much freedom as I did when I was 13. I could switch to the main campus next semester, but then I‚Äôm back to debating whether or not it‚Äôs worth taking on debt just for some more freedom. I‚Äôm struggling with feeling envious of my friends moving hours away from home and living life while I Iet myself be stuck in this situation.

I‚Äôm wondering what someone else in my position would do. Do I just tough it out for a few more years and move out then? Is it worth taking out ~$10k or more per year to live on the main campus? It could cost me more next year since most of my scholarships are non-renewable. There is also a pretty significant housing issue at this school, so off-campus housing would be difficult to find and expensive. I know I haven‚Äôt really given this campus a chance yet since I don‚Äôt start classes for a few more weeks, but I don‚Äôt know if I can imagine myself going here for 3 more years. I know I‚Äôm going to have to suck it up for this semester at least, but I‚Äôm thinking about what I should do next for the following semesters if I continue to feel dejected throughout this first semester.

"College major help","Hi, I‚Äôm 22 and my life has been a little chaotic. Growing up, my dream was to become a cartoonist ‚Äî to create cartoons and comics. I wanted to follow that dream, but art school was way too expensive. I planned to attend one in 2023, but I couldn‚Äôt afford it.

At first, I was okay with that. I decided I‚Äôd become a history professor and make comics on the side. I‚Äôm currently in community college, but then I shifted again and thought I‚Äôd become a therapist and get my LCSW. I planned to transfer to Temple University (in my state), earn a BSW, then go for an MSW.

But now, I‚Äôm questioning that path. I don‚Äôt really want to work with kids or inside mental hospitals ‚Äî I have trauma from my own upbringing that makes that environment feel unsafe for me. The truth is, I just want to make comics. I want to be an artist. I also love singing, dancing, theater ‚Äî all of it.

I need financial stability, though, and I‚Äôm not sure what to major in that will let me live my dream while also being realistic. Right now, I‚Äôm thinking of transferring to Temple in Fall 2026, majoring in Graphic and Interactive Design and minoring in Illustration. I‚Äôm also dreaming of moving to New York City after school. I‚Äôve lived in my hometown my whole life, and I want to experience the world and live life to the fullest.

My GPA is 3.5, and I come from a low-income background. I know that a UX design career might offer more financial security and I wouldn‚Äôt need grad school (which means less debt), but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs the best decision for me.

"Advice on moving out","I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve felt so stuck with my life the past 4 years. I‚Äôve had a lot of great experiences, travels, career mistakes and growth, but when it comes to really making a step to move forward‚Ä¶ I am frozen. No seriously, like once it becomes a topic I get so physically overwhelmed that I obsess over it and then don‚Äôt think about it for months.

I grew up really close to my family and went to college about 5 hours away. So we‚Äôve been apart. I did realize I loved my independence in college but I also realized how much I missed out on back home with my family.

3 years ago, my bf and I got a place together. I was so excited. But then after my parents left, I felt flooded with memories of my dogs and my childhood and I was genuinely depressed for a week. I started to get go home once a week and spend time with my animals and parents for a night. But this quickly became a habit.

We moved out of that apartment almost a year ago now and in with my parents (house is large so we have privacy and our own quarters) in hopes of saving money to move to the beach. However, after about 6 months into it, I had trouble finding a job and my boyfriend got promoted and has to be hybrid for the first year. So we decided we‚Äôd find another apartment. 

We thankfully got engaged at the beginning of this year, which is really exciting and I found a remote job and bartend on the side. 

Since then, I‚Äôve felt really stuck. Honestly no peace at all. 2 of my animals died suddenly 6 months apart and my soul dog is getting old and herniated his disc and developed a heart murmur. I started to feel like I was meant to stay longer to help him‚Ä¶ but I feel split. 

I love spending time with my family. My dog is everything to me. But deep down I know my now fianc√© and I need to lean into this era together and get our own place. I‚Äôve just gotten so used to the noise, coming home to animals, and eating dinner together every night. I wish I could bring my dog with me but for a long list of reasons, I cannot.

I just feel so lost. Every time we try to sign on an apartment, someone else signed before us instead.. it‚Äôs happened 3 times. Part of me thought of the beach again, but feel it‚Äôs not the right time with the wedding planning and my feelings.

But deep down, I feel stuck in the twilight zone almost. I feel super depressed and don‚Äôt feel like I have a second to myself in a year. We are constantly traveling and on the go and when I travel, I imagine myself living everywhere and feel so much joy. But I worry about moving back in with my fianc√© and feeling incredibly lonely. I worry that my parents will miss me and the guilt I feel is terrible. I worry my dog will get depressed. My mom also watches my baby nephew once a week and he loves spending time with me and always runs in my room. It breaks my heart that he wouldn‚Äôt understand.

I'm 34/m and live with my girlfriend. I moved to a larger city a few years ago with her to start a new job, which can be very stressful on its own. My mother recently decided to move to the same city 20 minutes away from me with her bf, but realistically was moreso her caretaker. Recently he got fed up with her and left her for good. My sisters have completely cut her off over 5 years ago. Her sister and brother haven't talked to her in years, after she sued them and just recently lost the case. Pretty much everyone... so I am the last holdout. 

Her bf/caretaker has been gone for about two months. She basically breaks even on her bills/food every month because she gets $2000 guaranteed in social security/disability. In the past two months I have been over there around 12-14 times... bringing food over, moving boxes, helping her unpack her storage unit, getting her money orders for rent, visiting daily the past week to take care of her dogs after she was committed to the mental ward for threatening to kill herself, getting her ubers, etc. Yet she says I do not help her and will keep making demands of me, such as picking her up from the hospital on a whim or dropping what I'm doing to go get her ginger ale, taking her dog to the vet, etc. 

 She blows my phone up, just today - 8 phone calls, probably around 60+ FB messages, and then calling my apartment complex to reach me... which they then pounded on my door until I woke up when I was on very little sleep. She basically expects me to find her a new apartment (which she doesn't qualify for income wise, to get approved but makes too much to get a restricted income unit), wants me to pretty much pay for her top full teeth replacement because she doesn't want dentures, blows my phone up crying for help all the time (whether it's due to her suicidal threats or medical issues... she basically goes to the hospital once every 2-3 months with new health issues, which has been a thing for at least the past 10+ years), watching/tending after her dogs when she's in the hospital/psych ward for days or longer, dealing with the police/her landlord, and so on. She will just blow my phone up whether I'm at work or asleep at 6-9 AM. 

Just to name a few of the terrible decisions she has made the past 10 years for context -

\* She had a fully paid off house with 3 acres of land that she lost because she didn't pay her $1,000 per year property taxes. Her father originally paid off the first three years for her and cleared her debt but then she let it stack up again, even though she had renters in it for awhile. The house was then taken by the county. 

\* Her father financed a nice SUV for her that she swore to him she would make the payments on... which she defaulted on shortly after getting it. He then took the car back from her and because he didn't want to see her without transportation, gave her his 2 yr old low mile camry, free and clear. She then takes a secured loan out against it, doesn't pay them, and loses the camry. 

\* My grandfather wrote her out of the trust/will due to behavior like this. She then sues my uncle and aunt for her supposed inheritance... even though they offered her my grandfathers house, or to setup a account to pay her major bills for her and give her $7,000 a year to do with as she saw fit. She just lost the case for having no merit, a few months ago.

\* Her long-term bf/caretaker just left her for good two months ago because he could no longer deal with her demands, poor choices, and overall behavior... so now she has double the bills. 

\* She has spent the little money she has, easily $20,000+ over the past 5 years trying to keep her 19 year old dog alive as long as possible. The dog is still suffering to this day and I'm trying to get her to put it down and rehome the other one because she is not fit to take care of it. She has also would send her own money to overseas Nigerian romance scammers, even though I and everyone else guaranteed her it was a scam.  

I feel like she is just a professional victim. I'm just not really sure what to do besides cut her off... She'll probably either become homeless or try to kill herself but she stresses me out so much to where it is starting to affect my physical and mental health. Every time I turn around there is a new problem/tragedy that she expects me to ""help"" her with. She says I do not want to help her even though literally in just the past week I have gone over every day after my 11 hour shifts to walk/feed her dogs, cleaned up after them inside because they refuse to go outside, deal with her landlord calling the police claiming her dogs are abandoned and putting notices on her door, got her several ubers home, offered to have ginger ale/water/dog food delivered, a cleaner come over to clean up after the dog messes inside, and a service that will put the dog down at her apartment.

"How to go to College When Poor","I‚Äòve given this advice enough as a comment to someone else‚Äôs post that I thought I might as well make my own post. I recently graduated from college in May with (almost) no debt. Earned my bachelors in Computer Engineering and I expect to have my student loans fully paid off before the end of the year. So here are the tips that helped me earn a bachelors relatively debt free while coming from a fairly poor family that was in no position to help me pay for college.

1. Work a part time job with tuition reimbursement the entire time you‚Äôre studying. This is the biggest one. My job offered $5,250 per year towards my tuition. Having an income while also having tuition reimbursement as a perk was by far the biggest factor in keeping debt down.


2. Don‚Äôt feel rushed to complete your degree in 4 years. I generally took 2-3 classes per semester. This gave me time to fit in a job. Taking less classes per year also helped keep me under that $5,250 year limit for tuition reimbursement. Taking an extra year or two to graduate is worth it if it means keeping your debt under control.


3. Take as many classes as you can at a community college before transferring to a University. Classes will be much cheaper.


4. Don‚Äôt go to an expensive college. It‚Äôs really not worth it. I had no problem finding a job after college and I didn‚Äôt go to some ivy league school. At full time status, just tuition at my University was about $7,000 per year.

 
5. Don‚Äôt live on campus. A lot of people want to do this, but it‚Äôs a great way to burn through money quickly. Live with your parents if possible, or at least a few roommates.


6. Work hard to be a great student. Merit based scholarships are a thing. I held a 4.0 GPA throughout most of my degree, and graduated with a 3.7. I received a couple thousand dollars every semester from merit based scholarships due to my academic performance. It pays to be a good student.

 
7. Just be responsible with your money in general. Cook at home, don‚Äôt spend $30 every day getting McDonalds delivered to your door. Save money!


Just about anyone can afford to go to college and graduate with little or no debt following these rules. The people that go into enormous debt are the ones not working, going to expensive colleges and living in dorms, taking a full load of classes and paying for it all with student loans, and paying for their bills and food with student loans while having no intentions of getting a job until after graduation. Don‚Äôt be that person. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1me1doj/how_to_go_to_college_when_poor/","1753967992.0","ApplyingToCollege","Coreyahno30"

"Im living through a 1950s mindset of working husband+SAHM... help","My husband goes to labor-intesive work 5am-3pm give or take. Often with lots of overtime. 

We have 2 children, one that I currently BF; neither go to school so its 24/7.

I do have a job out of the house 2 days a week, but I take my children with me. I make less than husband, but not by much. I dont know how to ask for help as a SAHM. 

I do all the house work (cleaning, laundry, pets, dishes, trash, etc.)   Cook every meal, and all the kids needs (teach, play, baths, feed, put to sleep, etc.) 

What my husband does around the house is:
 on the weekends he can put the baby to sleep for a nap, which is nice. 
And the occasional handy man tasks that needs to be done, which im greatful for. 
Other than that, his but is planted into the couch every other moment at home.

I really am extra burnt out from the constant work, literally never sitting down to just rest during the days, while I watch my husband sit down from the moment he gets home untill he goes to bed. Wishing I had help.

Husband kind of believes that's how working man + sahm should be. That's what he saw growing up. Anytime I ask him to do something, like washing some dishes,  he puts it off,  I'll remind him and he puts it off still, until it's too late to be done so I have to rush to get the job done. He knows I will do it out else we'll have no plates to serve dinner on by that point.  Idk what to do, or how to open his mind about contributions to the load but Im losing my mind here.

"When considering what university to choose to attend, which is more important, the course or the university itself?","I‚Äôm not sure if questions like this are allowed here, so I‚Äôll give it a shot. 

Hey guys! I (23M) have been accepted to two universities, and I‚Äôm thinking about which one to choose. Let‚Äôs call them uni A and uni B. I will start with some context first:

1: Both are located in different countries and different cities

2: they are different study programmes but I can get into the same field with both degrees

3: My long term plans include doing another bachelors after getting my degree, but in order to do that I need to prepare for it accordingly (private tutors and all that)

4: There are tuition fees for both universities but they are very cheap (both unis are in the EU)

I‚Äôll start telling you about the universities now.

Uni A: Is a relatively prestigious university (atleast in this country), with a decently diverse, and accepting background. Which is important for me, as I am part of the LGBTQ. The problem is I‚Äôm only half interested in course/study programme here. While I absolutely love the campus and the community around the university, i just don‚Äôt necessarily like the course all that much. I do hold some interest in it, though. The dorms, while a bit more expensive, are also much better equipped. Tuition is also cheaper here. It would take a little bit of an adjustment as it is a foreign university, I don‚Äôt speak the language (but the course also guarantees language learning, and the classes are in English so that‚Äôs not really a problem). But I would face a significant language barrier at first that‚Äôs for sure. I am sort of connected to this school however, and it sort of feels like a safe space.

Uni B: It is a religious university. You can already imagine why I‚Äôm conflicted about it, as someone who is part of the LGBTQ. While students report that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any discrimination, and the community seems accepting, I still feel worried. The university doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúentertain‚Äù the topic, nor does it acknowledges it, when it comes to academia topics concerning sexuality are out of the question it seems like. However I absolutely love the course/study programme here. It‚Äôs exactly what I would love to study. It would also give me more fields to specialise towards. However tuition is more expensive (though they are very flexible you can wait many years before paying it off, and is still considered cheap), and the accommodation options are just not great, though much cheaper. Language would not be a barrier here, and I could live my life a bit easier.

With all of this in mind, what advice can you guys give me? Which one would you go for if you were in my shoes? ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1me0kuc/when_considering_what_university_to_choose_to/","1753965885.0","ApplyingToCollege","_Nightfox_1"

so for starters, she had a really rough family background. her mother's heavily npd and gaslights her all the time. her dad's better but also kind of a jerk, they fund her together to study in the us. theyre pretty well off financially, but theyre cheap on her so shes always felt guilty spending any kind of money. shes been depressed and took a year off after sophomore year highschool, regardless she got a very good grade and went to florida for cs. her depression turned to bipolar after a few years.

its been really hard for her especially these few months as shes spending the summer back in china, and the new visa policy on international student, shes got so much things going on. she has to handle constant troubles and harrassments from her family especially with her fundings, visa problems she has to work through, let along things she needs to prepare for handling this coming school year like job networking, her school events (shes the president of an association in school so she has to also devote a fair amount of time on that), her increasing school work, and working her own mental problems. 

she really sounded depressed today when she talked today, and shes really troubled with all the errands that could potentially collapse her life if she screws up even one. she also said that shes tired all the time , shes got no respite, and she feels like she never will, especially with the financial pressure her family puts on her. the only way out she sees is her getting a job but with the current environment thats gonna be really hard too. 

her mental state, despite knowing how strong and capable she is, im worried. she might also be developing a bit of a drinking problem (not like a full blown middle aged white man scale but still, she seems to be leaning on alcohol to feel better. is 1-2 beer every other night a problem?).

"housing problems","i‚Äôm going into my senior year of college this fall, and i‚Äôm going to be student teaching. i‚Äôm struggling because i owe my school $3k, but if i decide to not live on campus, then i could afford it. i used to commute to my school but my family just moved to a different state this past spring, so i would have no where to go. 

i honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. i already have the full amount of the pell grant. i have work study. i have so many scholarships, grants, and loans already given from FAFSA and my college. everything is covered except for housing, and i can‚Äôt switch to living in the dorms (my current plan was the student apartments) because then i would be required to have a more expensive meal plan, which makes it the exact same price as the apartments with a cheaper meal plan. regardless, it still costs thousands of dollars that i do not have to live in the dorms. 

my school does have an emergency fund, but i used it last year due to family financial issues and i don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd let me use it again. i didn‚Äôt know i‚Äôd be owing this much money until a few weeks ago when the fall semester bills were released. my estimated bill from june only said i owed $400, so i wasn‚Äôt worried about it until this month. 

i don‚Äôt want to have to drop out when i literally have ONE semester left. i‚Äôm just struggling so much with money it‚Äôs insane, and my family can‚Äôt help because everyone is incredibly broke. should i still talk to financial aid? should i live in my car (with a cat, it probably won‚Äôt be possible)? any advice will help because i feel so alone and helpless.

"Organization tips for someone who has ADHD and really struggles with motivation?","Hello, I just wanted to see if anyone has any ideas for organization that would genuinely work for me. I have really bad ADHD (and it's highly suspected I'm autistic, although I'm not getting a formal diagnosis due to the current political climate), and I have really bad issues with motivation due to episodic depression. I'm really, really bad about procrastinating, especially when I get burnt out, to the extent that I'm often doing large swaths of work until I have to wake up, if not later. I've tried so many organization methods, setting alarms, using a planner, everything, but I can't get myself to do work, and my GPA has suffered because of it.
  I do have a 504, which includes things like having extended time, specifically on homework, however I don't want to rely on it, as I have even more trouble completing assignments AT ALL once the original due date has past. I'm also in a lot of AP/honors classes, which I am academically capable of doing well in, if I'm able to stay on top of assignments.
  I don't want basic advice with things I've tried before, like, you know, the standard stuff. What kind of advice for staying organized do you have that genuinely works, even if it is a little out there or counterintuitive? Thank you!

For reference: I've taken 3 APs this far, and every other class I've taken has been honors (excluding summer and ms classes). I have an unweighted GPA of ~3.35, and a weighted of ~3.9. I've gotten C's one semester in 2 of the AP classes, as well as 2 other C's (basically just in English), I just have a lot of A's in classes that are easy for me that balance it out.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1mec64w/organization_tips_for_someone_who_has_adhd_and/","1753992880.0","highschool","eleclay"

"Struggling To Choose Between Two D3 Volleyball Schools","Hi there. I am a female HS senior, and I have played on Varsity volleyball throughout high school, including this coming year. I have been recruited by many schools, but I‚Äôve narrowed it down to two schools: Widener University in Chester, PA, and St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY. My goal for recruitment was a high academic D3 school, and these two fit the bill, but I‚Äôve been struggling to decide which school to choose. I have visited both campuses and had a good experience at both places, as well as with the volleyball coaches of both schools. I‚Äôve done a lot of research, but I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I am stuck on which one may be the better option for me.  
  
Currently, I am interested in majoring in Psychology. However, I‚Äôm debating taking a clinical/neuroscience route or a more law/polysci route. Additionally, I am only worried about an undergraduate program at the moment.  
  
For some background about me, I am from a southern state, so I‚Äôm aware weather will be something to consider, although I do well with the cold. I am also from a decently populated area/city within my state that is commercialized with the majority of basic needs within 10 or so minutes away. I‚Äôm coming from a pretty large (\~1800 population) public school, so a private university will be a little different from what I‚Äôm used to. Also, I am an AP-level student, in addition to some dual enrollment and AP this year as a senior. By the end of senior year, I will have taken 10 APs (taken and passed 6 thus far) in addition to four dual enrollment courses, as well as all Honors classes.¬†

I am also homeschooled and so I have that background that might work against me there. I just want to know if these colleges would be a good fit for me.

"Small problems without small solutions","A privilege of the modern world is having small problems. I am not dying. I am not starving. I have a loving family. I have friends. I have small problems.



It feels like I have a lot of them.¬†



I believe it all began about two years ago when I decided to move in with my girlfriend at the time. We had been going out for 5 years at that point, so it felt like a natural progression, though I did have concerns. I wanted to stay in City 1 and keep my current job, but she needed a roommate in City 2 while she was finishing school and had‚Ä¶ ‚Äúdifficulties‚Äù with other roommates in the past, so she pressured me to move in with her. At the end of the day, I do believe it was my choice, but I do maintain that I felt pressured. Either way, we made plans to move in together and I was excited. I felt like I was going to be living the dream, but as it turns out, I would be doing quite the opposite. Long story short, as soon as we moved in together, the relationship soured and eventually turned emotionally abusive. I don‚Äôt proclaim innocence, but I know abuse when I see it.¬†



The writing was on the wall. We moved out from each other after two years and the relationship ended soon after. I miss it, sometimes, but I also see how often I was used and stepped on. I just miss our cats and her family, really. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but who is?



Anyways, that was 8 months ago. This has been the hardest time of my life. I live alone, and I don‚Äôt quite mind that, but it‚Äôs led to some really hopeless nights. I thought about hurting myself for a long, long time. Sometimes I would. I was losing friends left and right during this time, none of them really wanted to be there for me, and I don‚Äôt know if I can blame them. There was a lot of crying and emotional dumping, and a few extra wrinkles that I won‚Äôt get into. Just imagine a lot of small problems and you‚Äôll get the idea. I‚Äôve been a closeted trans person for years and finally decided to begin my transition. Town 1 is a smaller, more conservative town, but it was always supposed to be temporary. I plan on moving to City 2, but with that comes a lot of questions. How will I pay for a more expensive apartment? How will I pay for my student loans that will be starting payment soon? Should I get a car? How will I afford one? I need a new job! but a new job needs a car and a car needs money and then I need a new job‚Ä¶etc.¬†



A lot of small problems. I‚Äôve had friends who did, in fact, stick around and I have been so grateful to them. However, there is one fear that has been bouncing around my brain: finding another partner. I went on a few dates since the big break up, but it didn‚Äôt amount to anything other than 2 months of casual dates. I don‚Äôt mind that; I like taking things slow. However, I am really, deeply concerned about dying alone and I hate this song and dance of dating. I want to find someone who will truly love me FOR me. I want to feel wanted by a partner, for a change. I‚Äôm really worried that by finally transitioning, I‚Äôm locking myself into a single life-style forever. I don‚Äôt know if anyone can truly ‚Äúlove‚Äù me romantically, and it‚Äôs really freaking me out. I so badly wish I had ended things with my ex sooner. It‚Äôs so hard to meet people now.¬†



I don‚Äôt know what to do about anything. I have dreams about my ex which makes me ruminate (I see now how poorly treated I was). I apply for jobs and never hear back from them. I look at cars that I can never afford. I watch my student loans grow with interest. I look at Town 1, and admire its charm, but know that I cannot stay here. I swipe through dating apps without reciprocation. I live with fear, anxiety, guilt, anger, and remorse all day every day, but I do my best to smile through it all. I have my friends and I have my hobbies. I love to cook. I make a damn good soup. I just have a lot of small problems and they don‚Äôt go away.¬†



I‚Äôm going to keep applying to jobs. I am going to keep putting myself out there. I will not give up, no matter how much I want to, but I just wish these small problems had small solutions.¬†I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll be happy. I don‚Äôt know what I can do to ‚Äúcheck all of the boxes.‚Äù



i will say that it‚Äôs made excellent material for my book, which just hit 34k words, so that‚Äôs been nice, I guess.¬†","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mejfpt/small_problems_without_small_solutions/","1754011523.0","Adulting","The_Techies_Guy"

"Should I take a A- or a P/Np in my first class at college?","Hey everyone,

I'm currently a first year student at UC Berkeley and could really use some advice. I'm taking two classes this term:

A 4-unit elective class where I'm doing well and expecting an A
A 3-unit elective that's unrelated to my major
In the elective, I‚Äôm on track for an A‚Äì, but I'm worried that the 3.7 GPA points from that A‚Äì will lower my overall GPA. Since I have an A in the other class, my GPA would drop from a 4.0 to about a 3.87 if I take the A‚Äì for a letter grade.

I‚Äôm torn ‚Äî I know a 3.87 is still great, but I‚Äôm aiming to keep my GPA as high as possible in case I go for competitive internships or jobs in the future. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want it to look bad that I took a class P/NP.

Does taking an elective P/NP look bad to employers or future opportunities (especially in business/VC/tech)? Or is it smarter to protect my GPA here since the class doesn‚Äôt count toward my major anyway? Also I think some internships and job apps only ask for gpa not even your transcript so they wouldn‚Äôt even see the p/no but they would see if my gpa dropped.

"In-person classes advice + science/lab questions","Hey everyone!

I'll be headed back to school in a few weeks after deciding to pursue a career in nursing. I'll be starting off at my local community college for my associates degree in nursing before transferring elsewhere for my BSN. But first, I have to knock out all of my remaining pre-reqs. I already have an unrelated bachelor's degree from a few years ago, so I'm not too out-of-the-loop when it comes to college. But still, so much has changed since then, and I did every single one of those courses online. So this Fall will be my first time doing in-person classes and I'm stressing out. I'll be taking Microbiology + Lab and a Nursing Nutrition course in person, and A&P I + Lab and statistics online.

Sooooo for in-person classes, I have a few questions:
‚Ä¢ Do you guys usually use a laptop/Chromebook primarily for taking notes or do you write them in a notebook? Also, what Chromebook size would you recommend?
‚Ä¢ For those that have taken both online and in-person classes before, what would you say are the main differences?
‚Ä¢ Do you take tests online still even for an in-person class? My assumption is that the in-person class times is essentially the same as the recorded lectures that I would watch for my online classes. Do you do any work in class or is it usually just the lecture and everything else is online still?
‚Ä¢ Any other advice for in-person classes?

Also, this is the first time I'll actually be taking a science course in college (previous science courses were taken in high school AP classes). This may sound like a dumb question, but how exactly do science lectures and labs work? Why are they split into two different classes instead of a single 4-credit lecture and lab course (for my community college at least) - I'm going to have 2 different professors for the lecture and lab. How does the lab professor know what we've learned in the lecture so far (I mean yeah there's a syllabus that is supposed to used as a guideline, but what if we fall behind a little). Also, what exactly is the difference between the lecture and lab? Is the lecture strictly the professor talking and the lab is strictly hands on? Or is there a bit of crossover between the two? Do you have tests/quizzes for the lab? Do you do a different lab each week or is it one or two labs that you complete throughout the semester? What are the labs mostly graded on - I assume lab reports? I'm just so stressed out because science courses in high-school were obviously way different and we barely did actual labs even on our lab days.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1meku5z/inperson_classes_advice_sciencelab_questions/","1754015599.0","college","whateverthewhatev"

"Please review my PS of engineering college","¬†¬†¬†I had just left my volleyball practice, my leg stiff from a painful cramp, and couldn‚Äôt even bend my legs. It was winter in Ulaanbaatar, and the streets were almost empty. The roads were faded in Ulaanbaatar's smoke, only night lights lighting the way. I¬† thought the hardest part of my day had ended. Until I saw him.

¬†¬†¬†The bus station reeked of diesel smell, and the bus leaves a thick black smoke behind. When I slowly walk past, as see a man slumped in the corner, blood trickling from his nose. I had no idea what to do. The sight overwhelmed me, and I just chose to leave.¬†

¬†¬†¬†A few steps later, two men approached me. One of them grabbed me. I tried to resist, but I couldn‚Äôt move my legs normally. They pull apart my coat, trying to take anything they can. Around me, people just walked away, but no one intervened. Not even a glance. I was invisible.

¬†¬†¬†Furious and terrified, my fear transformed into rage. Angry and cruel words flew from my mouth, and I didn't even recognize them as my own. I shouted out, blaming them, blaming the situation.

¬†¬†¬†One of them stopped and he told me, ‚ÄúDo you know what kind of life I've lived? Do you know what it‚Äôs like to be thrown out by your own family?‚Äù he said. Later, these two men disappeared into the night.

I stood here, shivering, his words echoing in the air. His words touched my soul. I had always believed that people ended up becoming homeless because of bad choices. But maybe they didn‚Äôt choose anything at all.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Walking home that night, I could not stop thinking the problems lying beneath this human tragedy. I was raised in a community of people who love me, who was with me through difficult times, I was raised in a house where somebody listened, where on tough days, there was a hot meal waiting. Nevertheless, I understand all people ain‚Äôt the same as people I knew, they ignored me when I needed their help, not even a glance. That night revealed the distance between my life and theirs.

¬†¬†¬†It also revealed a deeper problem, why do we make societies where suffering is invisible? Why is a person left bleeding on a bus station corner, unnoticed?

This is not humanity. I believed we had left behind the society where the strong thrive and the weak get trampled. What is behind this human behaviour?,¬† I still couldn‚Äôt figure out that question. Even so, I know what I can do. While my classmates see STEM as abstract, I see weapon for equality and justice.

In Mongolia, I've seen how winter temperatures can drop to -30¬∞C, making homelessness not just uncomfortable but deadly.I started to ask, how can they live a better life? How can materials science create better, low cost insulation? How can cities be designed to offer safety for everyone? I no longer see STEM as abstract formulas, I see it as a tool for dignity and justice.

¬†¬†¬†I want to study in an environment that encourages using science not just for innovation. Whether it‚Äôs designing affordable shelters or creating technology that connects people in underserved areas to support networks, I want my work to reflect that night, cold, painful, and unforgettable.

I aspire to become the kind of scientist who sees people others overlook. That winter evening didn‚Äôt just changed how I perceive the world. It gave me a purpose in it.

_________________
Classes are starting soon, and honestly everything is starting to hit. (i‚Äôve been having a mental breakdown this whole day) To be honest I‚Äôm getting the jitters for this year because I will be doing a lot this year and I fear I wont be as good as last year. 

Last year as a sophomore, I held a-lot of responsibilities and did a-lot of things I never thought would happen. Like winning a history competition, going to state competitions, and winning $100 from a museum. I even won a 20K scholarship somehow after being nominated for it by my school! I got a 4 in AP Bio, was the best writer in my history and english class. That‚Äôs the tip of the ice berg. 

This year, I‚Äôll be doing so much, and I‚Äôm terrified I wont be good enough for my dream school (UC Berkeley/UC Davis). I don‚Äôt know If I‚Äôll be handle AP Chem because I‚Äôve never had a Chem class, but I really want to take that class since I want to be a Chemical engineer.
Im doing both history and speech competitions. Taking Ap lang, which is ironic because I have horrible grammar since english is not my first language. I‚Äôll be Volunteering every week at a food bank! In the student gov as a board member and handling club events. Vice-President in a history club and president in a food bank club. 

And I still have to juggle studying for the SAT, applying for scholarships, internships, etc. 

My summer composed of me taking my college summer class, volunteering, trying to study for SAT, preparing for my history competition, organizing clubs, and managing paper work for it. AND YET, I still feel like its not enough and I‚Äôm terrified of starting junior year.

I already have about $6000 saved up and can get $1500 a year from my job‚Äôs reimbursement program, but it‚Äôs not enough to cover the remaining 48 credits I have.

"‚ÄúLiving with‚Äù family question","‚ÄúLiving with‚Äù question

Hi, this isn‚Äôt recent but I‚Äôm still concerned. 


On my (approved) dependency appeal from ~10 years ago, I noted having last ‚Äúlived‚Äù with my parents around a certain time, but I‚Äôm not sure if that statement is exactly correct or open to interpretation and I‚Äôm nervous about it being potentially misleading, but my intention at the time was NOT to mislead. 

I considered it my last time ‚Äúliving‚Äù with them because I came home from college for break and got into a routine of doing things like my usual job, unpacked some belongings, etc. 

However a few months later when the semester ended I did stay with them for a bit less than 2 weeks? However I did not do things like unpack my belongings or start working. I considered it not ‚Äúliving‚Äù there since everyone knew my stay was temporary and I‚Äôd be leaving quite soon. I had told my parents I was going to be subletting for the summer but I was actually couch surfing because I couldn‚Äôt deal with living with my family anymore. I had postponed moving out of the dorms as late as I could, but there was a gap between the dorms closing and my friend being able to take me in. 

The difference in time frame between the time I said I last lived with them and this visit was approximately two months. Both time periods were well over a year before I filed my appeal. 

After that I had a few(3-4) short visits but did not generally stay more than one night. The last time I had ever visited my parent‚Äôs home was noted accurately in my appeal. It had been nearly a year before my appeal was filed. It was also the last time I‚Äôd seen my parent in person. 


However the last time I‚Äôd been in contact with them, period, may have been off by 2-3 months because I didn‚Äôt realize that the small amount of contact I‚Äôd had with them over text(mostly me reaching out to them and them not responding) after that ‚Äúcounted‚Äù since the relationship was dead to begin with by that point. I didn‚Äôt talk to them on the phone anymore after the timeframe listed in my appeal because they were horrible to me on the phone and behaved slightly more reasonably over text, but they also refused to communicate over text and would demand I called them. 


I suspect they didn‚Äôt want me to be able to screenshot abusive language. So the time stated in my appeal was the last time we‚Äôd spoken on the phone, as in, a phone call. I was no contact with my parent for at least 4-5 months before my appeal was filed but I don‚Äôt have a way to verify it because all phone records from this time would def be gone by now. 

For my other parent, I had never met them or been in contact with them and didn‚Äôt even know how to contact them. I was asked to verify this by the financial aid office but couldn‚Äôt do so because all of the court documentation related to this parent was with my other parent, who I wasn‚Äôt in contact with and who had previously refused to give me documents like my social security card and birth certificate. I explained that the documents were with my other parent, and my school did not press further. 


My school also reached out to me to verify my health insurance situation, because I didn‚Äôt mention it in my appeal, but I clarified that I was still in my parent‚Äôs insurance policy(I had waived school coverage). This did not end up impacting my appeal outcome though I was worried it would. 

Years later it was an ordeal to be removed from this policy because the insurance company refused to do it without permission from my parent. I had an insurance through work by that point and both insurance policies declared each other the primary, which left me with $$$ healthcare expenses out of pocket and no recourse. We nearly had to get a lawyer involved but eventually the insurance company backed down and removed me. I suppose it‚Äôs difficult to prescribe intent but I do believe my parent kept me on their policy despite me being married and full time employed as a means of trying to force me to contact them to be taken off of it. I was not even aware I was still on the policy until I started getting large medical bills. 



In my appeal I‚Äôd stated I‚Äôd cut contact with ‚Äúfamily‚Äù but I had some contact with family members not living with my parents, I‚Äôm not sure if that counts? I maybe should have specified but considered that only parents mattered for this. Definitely did not intend to misrepresent anything here, it was just imprecise language. Elsewhere in my appeal I believe it was noted that I‚Äôd been in slightly better relationship with one family member but had to come to an agreement with them that it wasn‚Äôt safe for me to attend a large family event due to the risk of seeing my parent there and them causing a scene. 


I‚Äôm just really worried that little details like this might come back to haunt me with legal or otherwise consequences someday. I know how difficult it is to have dependency appeals and PJ appeals in general accepted. and I know how bad the penalties are for things like false statements and perjury. 


To what extent are details like this material/determinations?  If it matters at all my parents were low income so I qualified for nearly full financial aid(Pell grant) to begin with, and we‚Äôve never reconciled in the years since. I actually moved away from the area partially to avoid accidentally running into them. I believe my appeal may have been approved on the basis of my homelessness rather than my lack of contact with parents, but there‚Äôs no way for me to know for sure. The appeal only covered one year. 

If you‚Äôre wondering why I care, it‚Äôs because I am struggling with legal/moral scrupulosity themes in obsessive compulsive disorder. I know it‚Äôs not healthy to have this level of anxiety and I‚Äôm really struggling through it. 


If you work in financial aid office, have you ever had to refer anyone to OIG/FSA? Or is it mostly reserved for egregious things like straw student scams?

"Here‚Äôs what actually helped me get into a top school as an international student (w/ no counselor or $$)","Hey! Thought I‚Äôd share what I actually used during apps, in case anyone else is navigating this solo like I was. I‚Äôm from a school where no one had ever applied abroad,  no counselor, no alumni, no support system. I also didn‚Äôt have the money for consultants or essay editors. Still, I managed to get into a top U.S. school, and here‚Äôs exactly what helped me:

  
SAT: 

* Khan Academy SAT:  I focused on understanding the structure of the test and repeated question types.
* SuperTutorTV (YouTube):  Great strategy videos, especially for pacing and tricky reading questions.
* Erica Meltzer‚Äôs blog:  Her SAT reading strategies were gold. Borrowed The Critical Reader from my local library.
* Understanding the test structure matters more than chasing perfection. Focus on how the SAT is designed,  question types, timing, common traps,  instead of stressing over getting every single answer right. Strategic prep > flawless prep.

Essays + app tips: 

* I didn‚Äôt aim to look perfect, I focused on showing how my experiences shaped my goals. I tied everything back to a personal story.
* I read essays on College Essay Guy and watched breakdowns on YouTube (e.g. John Fish, The Admission Angle). These helped me find the right tone.
* A reminder: you‚Äôre usually compared to students from your region, not globally. So focus on what makes you stand out in your context, even if that‚Äôs your school, community work, or approach to problems.
* I also was also a part of a mentoring program that connected me with someone who‚Äôd already been through the process, hands down the most helpful thing I did ( called project access) 
* Contextualize your grades + achievements. If you have a grade in some class that looks ‚Äúlow‚Äù on paper, explain it in context. Some school systems are tougher than others, so if you‚Äôre top 5% in your class, say that. And make sure your recommenders also mention how your performance stands out within your school or country. U.S. colleges care about how you did relative to your environment, not just the number. So if yk ur grade is among the best in the class but it just looks "" low"" on paper bc of the grading scale, make sure ur recommenders clarify that. 
* Avoid the generic ‚Äúglobal citizen‚Äù essay angle. Admissions officers see this one a lot, especially from international students. Instead of vague claims about cultural exposure or being globally minded, lean into your personal, specific background, where you‚Äôre from, what shaped your perspective, what drives you. Make it something only you could have written. ( not saying u can't make this one work, but just a heads up)
* Choose someone who really knows you, not just the ‚Äúhighest status‚Äù teacher. Since many teachers outside the U.S. aren‚Äôt familiar with U.S. rec letter norms, consider giving them a short bullet list of your key traits, achievements, and what you‚Äôd love them to mention. This is normal and helpful, not pushy. Also you usually can submit the rec letters in your native language as long as u submit a offically  translated version with it!

Hope this helps even a little now that apps are opening. My DMs are always open if you're feeling overwhelmed or just need someone who's been through it.

"I have a personal conundrum regarding moving out","So I won't get to deep into details, but I (24f) moved out of my home town to a big city a few years back, but I did so with the intent of keeping my Mother(63) company. 
Currently we rent together and split rent 50-50 but I'm longing for experiences renting with people outside of my family. She moved down for work and was living alone and I felt anxious about her mental wellbeing while she lived alone which is the reason why I chose to rent with her. 

While I enjoy spending time with her, a part of me is dejected that I feel like I'm making a tradeoff. I'm choosing spending time with my mum to try and make connection in spite of the heavily flawed, emotionally absent but loving relationship I've had while growing up but know that I miss out on the experience of socialising and networking through rooming with people I don't know. 

I'm pretty awkward unfortunately, I feel that I have a bit of a personality (both in a good and quirky way) I'm really OCD on keeping tidy, however I am also very mentally depressed and have mental health challenges that really make pushing through leave me a shallow husk. 
I've only just started doing some amount of higher education as an apprentice, but I feel immense distress at the fact that I both do and don't want to do this course. 
I do because it looks good on my resume and work history, but don't because the place I'm at isn't compliant with anything I'm being taught. I feel like I'm loosing my mind because it's an issue at upper management I can't contest. 


I want to experience the unique bonds and stresses that come with renting with people I've never met but also I don't know how and I feel immense guilt at leaving my Mother by herself. I am rather aggravated by my inability to articulate my thoughts in a socially acceptable manner that doesn't rub people the wrong way (it's highly likely that I am AuDHD but I am not diagnosed) and despite that I have a strong yearning to make a fool of myself and try to make those connections anyhow. 
I don't know if anyone has a similar experience or any insight that might provide some level of clarity, feel free to pitch in. 

I just want to make things and be surrounded by people who care as much as I do but also understand work life balance and care about that as strongly as what's being done while working.

"[METHOD] How I rebuilt my life from rock bottom to discipline in 6 months","Six months ago, I was the definition of a mess. Waking up at 3pm, eating junk food in bed, doom scrolling until 5am. My room looked like a tornado hit it. I was basically a human sloth surviving on study loans while ignoring my classes completely. This went on for months until I realized I had to change my life or I'd be stuck forever.

TLDR: Start reading non-fiction daily and apply what you learn. Build the habit on willpower, not motivation. Use modern tools to make reading addictive. Your brain will literally rewire itself.

# HABIT BUILDING

The game changer for me was reading ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Clear breaks down the science of why we fail and gives you a bulletproof system that actually works.

The biggest mistake I made at first was relying on motivation. I'd get hyped up, promise myself I'd read for 2 hours daily, then crash and burn after 3 days. Motivation is like weather, it comes and goes. You can't build your life on something that unstable.

The solution is willpower plus stupidly small requirements. Instead of ""I'll read 50 pages because I'm motivated,"" say ""I'll force myself to read 1 page because I have enough willpower for that."" Make it so small you can't fail.

Here's the psychology behind why this works. Once you sit down with the book and read that one page, you'll usually keep going. Your brain doesn't want to stop once it's started. But if you set a huge goal and feel overwhelmed, you won't even start.

Try it right now. Go grab any book and read one page. I guarantee you have the willpower for that.

# READING

This is where the magic happened for me. Reading non-fiction daily was the one habit that changed everything else. I got an e-reader and started carrying it everywhere. Public transport, waiting in lines, before bed, it became my default activity.

The benefits hit different when you experience them yourself. You're learning directly from the smartest people who ever lived. Einstein, Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, they're all waiting on your bookshelf. There are books on literally anything you find interesting.

But here's what most people don't realize about reading. It rewires your brain. When you read, you create new neural pathways. You're upgrading your mental operating system every single day. After six months of consistent reading, I feel like I have access to hundreds of brilliant minds.

Books that completely changed my perspective: ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist who breaks down the science of self-control), ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the psychology of optimal experience), and ""Meet Your Happy Chemicals"" by Loretta Breuning (how your brain chemicals actually work).

I've tried everything to make reading more accessible and addictive. Physical books are great but since I got my new job in banking I seldom have time to read full books. My friend put me onto a smart reading app called BeFreed that turns books into engaging and personalized podcasts. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host‚Äôs voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha). It also builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I‚Äôd be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I‚Äôve replaced TikTok with knowledge. Essential sources for any lifelong learner.¬†

I also use Fable to track my reading, discover new books, and stay motivated through the community. For me, the goal is to remove every barrier to consuming knowledge.

The compound effect is insane. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Concepts from one book connect to ideas in another. You start seeing patterns everywhere. Your conversations get deeper. Your problem-solving improves. Friends notice you're giving better advice.

# DOPAMINE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY

This part blew my mind when I learned about it. Most people think dopamine equals pleasure, but that's wrong. Dopamine is actually about wanting and motivation. It's what drives you to seek rewards.

Here's the problem. Social media, Netflix, junk food, they all give massive dopamine hits. Way more than anything in nature ever would. Your brain gets addicted to these super-stimuli. When you're constantly getting these artificial highs, normal activities feel boring.

Reading trains your brain to focus on one thing for extended periods. It's like meditation but you're also gaining knowledge. You're teaching your dopamine system to find satisfaction in learning and growth instead of mindless consumption.

After a few weeks of consistent reading, I noticed my attention span improving. I could focus longer on tasks. The constant need to check my phone decreased. Reading became my replacement for doom scrolling.

# FLOW STATES

One book that changed how I think about activities is ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is when you're completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time. You forget about yourself. You're just present with the task.

Reading creates natural flow states. When you're deep in a good book, hours feel like minutes. This is your brain operating at peak performance. You're not distracted or scattered. You're fully engaged.

The difference between pleasure and enjoyment hit me hard. Pleasure activities give you dopamine but don't make you grow. Scrolling TikTok is pleasurable but empty. Reading is enjoyable because it challenges you and makes you better.

I started filling my days with more flow activities. Reading, learning guitar, having deep conversations. These activities are harder than passive entertainment but infinitely more rewarding.

# PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Start tonight with one page. Any book that interests you. Self-help, fiction, biography, doesn't matter. The goal is building the habit first.

Keep a book or e-reader visible somewhere you'll see it daily. I put mine next to my coffee maker so I'd see it every morning.

Replace one mindless activity with reading. Instead of scrolling while you eat breakfast, read. Instead of watching random YouTube videos before bed, read.

Track your progress somehow. I use a simple habit tracker app. Seeing the streak build up becomes addictive.

Join online communities about reading. Reddit has amazing book communities. Goodreads helps you discover new books and track what you've read.

The crazy part is that six months ago, I thought people who read regularly were just naturally disciplined. Now I realize discipline is just a habit you build one page at a time. Reading taught me that I'm not broken or lazy. I just needed better systems and knowledge about how my brain actually works.

Anyone can do this. You don't need special talent or motivation. You just need to start ridiculously small and be consistent. Your future self will thank you for starting today.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mf20xd/method_how_i_rebuilt_my_life_from_rock_bottom_to/","1754067823.0","Adulting","luckkyyy4ever"

I'm pretty much just writing about my crystal/rock collection, and how most of the pieces in my collection relate to the different people who have given them to me (mostly members of my family), or the places I've lived/traveled to, and how that's led to me becoming the person I am today.

  
Honestly, I love this essay, and it makes me happy to write about this topic, but I'm not sure admissions officers would like it. The only other topics I can think of to write about are how a childhood anecdote led me to choosing my career (nursing), or about how one of the teachers I was closest to passed away my junior year, and how that grief affected me. However, I don't really want to trauma dump on the AOs, or bring up something from childhood in my personal essay.

Literally, my worst fear of going to high school was dealing with messy, rude people. No, I don‚Äôt expect it to be like High School Musical. No matter what grade, people are immature as hell. The school is very diverse I‚Äôll give them that but it‚Äôs not very welcoming. You either have played against someone their in a sport or come in their with big ass friend groups. People there were so rude and entitled. Freshmen, seniors, or administrators, specifically the girls, straight rude. Some of the girls were loud, talking to boys, and had nasty attitudes. A girl and her friend tried to press me and my friend all because she didn‚Äôt hear us say hello back. Then other girls always giggling behind us.. They become very bold just because they‚Äôre by their friends . I gratefully came with friends, THANK GOD! It made my experience better also making me braver to talk to random people. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think I made any connections where I‚Äôll talk to them on the first day besides my friends.

One of my friends left very early. I felt very bad, she‚Äôs already so quiet and then was put in a group with no one familiar. I don‚Äôt blame her because it was very overwhelming.

"How do i move to a new state?","I'm 21 and I currently live in Florida, I don't have a degree, I currently work at a local recycling facility making 18 an hour which is ok for the part of Florida I live in, I have around 15k saved up and around 50k in investments, I have no debt, no kids, no pets and no dependents, I'm basically a free agent. I was born and raised here but my resent for this place grows every year. Factors like the political climate, the weather and the surging prices on basically everything are driving me out of Florida. I want to become either an electrical or welding apprentice but Florida being an anti-union state It doesn't leave me with many choices, and I also don't intend to spend 5 years completing the apprenticeship here. I'm going to get downvoted, but the areas I'm eyeing are the pacific northwest (Expensive i know) or the Midwest. Once I choose a location i expect myself to move by Late January-Early February. I'd probably try to get employed at USPS which will allow me to move with a job lined up but that is not guaranteed. I'd be moving by plane and won't be taking a lot of belongings with me; id basically be starting fresh in another state. I want to know if my plan is idiotic or if its reasonable and grounded.

"Spiraling about not meeting requirements","Hi everyone, I really need advice on what to do. My dream school was WVU for forensic science, and i thought I would be able to go.

I thought I would be fine for act, but I just found out that my school does act workkeys and not act, so now im freaking out.

"Common App Essay Topic: Art or Weightloss?","Hi! I‚Äôve been thinking about what direction to take for my Common App essay, but I can‚Äôt decide between two options.

Option 1: My passion for art
I‚Äôve always loved art as a hobby‚Äîdrawing, painting, and more. I‚Äôve accomplished a lot with art and have made money by commissioning paintings. It‚Äôs my greatest talent, and I feel like the more I grow as a person, the better my art gets. But I‚Äôm struggling with how to structure an essay around this.

Option 2: My weight loss journey
This has been a huge part of my life and personal growth. I was obese and had a very negative mindset. After I started learning about fitness and lost 70 pounds, I came out with an entirely different way of thinking. It taught me so much about discipline, building good habits, and most importantly, loving and taking care of myself.

My dilemma:
Both feel like strong topics, and I want my essay to have one clear direction rather than two ideas competing with each other. I thought about connecting them somehow, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that authentically.

I‚Äôm more drawn to the weight loss story because I feel like it would be easier to write about, and I experienced the most internal growth through that journey. But I‚Äôm worried it might be a sensitive topic or not what admissions officers want to read about. I also wonder if it‚Äôs not unique enough since many people write about weight loss.

Any thoughts or feedback would be really helpful!","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mf5tsg/common_app_essay_topic_art_or_weightloss/","1754076498.0","ApplyingToCollege","cinnamoncat22"

"Common App Essay Topic: Too trauma dumpy/basic and possibly insensitive?","I'm c/o 26 trying to go into nursing and my current idea behind my essay is that in the past decade I faced emotional instability in my household and 80% of the time my family had to medical, dental or vision insurance bc of sort of job instability? The whole idea ties into how my family including myself had medical problems ranging from blurred vision to cancer that we couldn't treat except every two years when we flew out to Asia to visit family where treatment is significantly cheaper mixed with my passion for community service and the medical field made me want to go into nursing. Also my strongest extra curricular is community service and is one of the main themes of my application, which ties into the struggles I experienced. 

However I'm a little worried that this is too much trauma dumping and if its too basic bc millions of Americans are in the same position as me except I have the luxury of being able to fly out of the country to get whatever treatment I need + my family doesn't struggle with bills and putting food on the table and we live pretty comfortably and it might just be a pity party. I'm also scared that I prob just think my situation is bad because I go to school with kids who's parents make 200K+ a year have private doctors that drive to their house and I look ""poor"" compared to them and admissions officers may just think that this was an insensitive topic when I'm not actually struggling financially, just America's medical system is f-ed up and we can't really drop a month's salary on a ct scan. I feel like it is comparable to the ""divorced kid"" basic topic bc both are like ""my home life was unstable and I grew from that!"" which is not a good topic or at least that's what I've heard.

"Pls help","Please adults - ambitious depressed people who have been lost or are lost HELP! Or people who change the course of their lives. I really need advice and help. I‚Äôm so lost and considering ending my life because I‚Äôm so overwhelmed. 

I‚Äôve struggled with ED+depression since 14, now 26. I‚Äôve studied something I hated since the beginning (law), wasted time with my ex (5 years) who I never even wanted to be together with in the first place. Just an infinite people pleaser with no own sense of direction. 

I‚Äôve had so much potential and ideas and thoughts and didn't act on any of these. I‚Äôve just wasted my time in total misalignment with myself and I literally hate my life and what I am today. I‚Äôll soon graduate and I mourn my past for all the energy I put into other‚Äôs wishes, my ED, wrong education and just procrastination. I probably have undiagnosed ADHD. 

I have so much hate towards myself, and I never liked what I did. I just wanna start over (go back in time) and do things SO differently and just be more bold and listen to my gut, and live according to it. I‚Äôve silenced my gut for so long and now I‚Äôm in a completely wrong world. Like this is not what my life should look like - but I have literally no idea what I should do. I‚Äôm like, do I join a monastery, do I go into corporate law, do I just go and work in a clothing store and just fucking CHILL, do I go and travel and see the world and maybe get som perspective, do I study something that I actually think that interests me (like psychology)? I‚Äôve always been confident and pretty and liked. But all of this was never real. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve just chameleon myself my entire life, being something and someone I‚Äôm not. Hiding myself and my needs and opinions and wants. Like my ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù was just rooted in the need of being accepted by everyone. 

I‚Äôm at a tipping point with this. Life has literally come crashing down, and I have no idea what I should do. I‚Äôm kinda suicidal all the time, cause I feel like no matter what I choose to do, I‚Äôll lose. If I choose to travel, I lose economic security. If I choose to work in corporate (which is also a hard battle cause of the job market), I‚Äôll regret going back to what I literally HATED and what drained my soul. If I go work in just regular jobs I‚Äôll look crazy to my peers, and like I‚Äôve failed. I don‚Äôt feel like I belong anywhere and literally I don‚Äôt have an identity right. 

I just look back at my life from 18-now, and just mourn all the time and energy that was lost. Sure, I‚Äôve had good moments too - of course. But I never did what I wanted to do. Now I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with having to be ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, (but also wanting to be something), to live up to my previous life. Like I literally am so lost I don‚Äôt know what I should do. Probably any of these options are better than suicide, cause at least then I‚Äôll have tried something. But like I‚Äôm so afraid of making any choices, or listening to myself cause clearly I only make bad decisions and can‚Äôt trust myself. 

PLEASE if someone has these feelings or can relate OR has overcome this, can you please share your story? I just really need to hear like rock bottom stories or something to get some hope‚Ä¶ or just ideas?

"Graduating tomorrow, I don‚Äôt feel good about it","So I started off my college career majoring in chemistry and minoring in art. I always had a passion for both so I felt like this was a great plan for me. 

Halfway through though, I had a horrible experience in my life and fell into a deep depression. I failed classes but not enough to fail out of college as a whole. This caused me to be in college for an extra year. Afterwards, learning that I would have to take even longer to graduate with my current major, I decided to flip my major and minor so that I could just be done with college as soon as I could. By this point, all I cared about was graduating. I wanted to get school over with now.

I didn‚Äôt want a crowd for my ceremony, but family members kinda invited themselves on their own and so now they‚Äôre going too, and they still think I‚Äôm majoring in chemistry. I don‚Äôt speak to them often, but every time I did it was always ‚Äúwhen are you finishing up school?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you thought about what you‚Äôll do afterwards? Youll have lots of opportunities.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù It kills me every time.

And I can‚Äôt flat out say that Im now majoring in art after all that stuff about chemistry. I definitely feel like a failure and that I wasted this opportunity to become better and successful in the future, and I pretty much did, but if I hadn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know how I would‚Äôve continued. I was in a terrible headspace. 

Now I‚Äôm actually really good at art. I was the ‚Äúartist‚Äù of the family since I was a kid, anyway. But I am also smart. I love chemistry, graduated in the top ten in my class back in high school.

I wish they understood what I went through during this time, but I know once they understand that I went for a degree in the arts, that‚Äôs all they will see.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mf94ro/graduating_tomorrow_i_dont_feel_good_about_it/","1754084475.0","college","South_Weakness1927"

"College ghosting me on every opportunity?","I finished my freshman year and I have been fortunate enough to land some incredible opportunities for next year. I should be ecstatic, but honestly, I'm just stressed out of my mind all for the wrong reasons. It feels like I'm being professionally ghosted by my own university, and I am losing my mind checking my email every 30 seconds and preparing for the disaster next year is going to be.

I'm dealing with a complete and utter lack of communication for multiple positions, and it's making me doubt everything.

First is my Research Job.

This is a huge deal. It is a scholarship-based research position for only four students. They laid out a timeline for lab placements and training, but then never gave me the information needed to get started. I have been incredibly patient, only emailing them three or four times over the past two months. Each time I am told ""I'll hear back by the end of the day,"" but I wait two full weeks before following up again, and still nothing. I have no idea what lab I am in or what I will be doing, and I am stressing about how I'm supposed to be prepared when school starts. Genuinely all I want to do is go off on them in email for giving me an amazing opportunity and being so shady about it.

Next is a TA Job

This is the one that's really driving me crazy. I was offered a TA first year course position back in May. They mentioned training in June and another session in late August. Since then, I have just gotten a few useless mass emails saying they're ""working on it."" I understand that this is stressful to plan out for the 300 students  but the people in charge of this has been doing this for over 20 years and have been able to train every student on time or at the very least been open and honest. I can't wrap my head around this being so last-minute and disorganized. I don't even know if I'm officially in the program anymore. From what I am aware of most students have been getting responses and placement done but a few of them (which of course includes me) have not gotten any info. The person in charge even tells us constantly to email for any questions but they never respond back. Even if they talk to me today, this late into summer I do not how they would train me properly.

Other Roles:

I also have a student president role and a volunteer position where I'm waiting on more info. It's the same infuriating pattern: ""I'll get back to you tomorrow,"" followed by silence. For these ones I only found out about these 1-2 weeks ago but I'm starting to get PTSD from being ""ghosted"".

I'm so excited about these opportunities, but the stress of this communication black hole is making it impossible to prepare or feel confident. Is this level of unprofessionalism and disorganization a normal part of the college experience, or is this genuinely weird?

I honestly do not even know if this is all because it is summer and faculty are busy, but I do not find that to be an excuse to ""lie"" to me. I do not know if this is dramatic to say but I never felt this disrespected in my life. God only knows how hard I worked last year and to work so hard to get these opportunities and feel like I am loosing them all is truly so disrespectful.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mfaqna/college_ghosting_me_on_every_opportunity/","1754088607.0","college","SympathyAgitated5853"

My supervisors will write a letter of recommendation affirming that I did quality work, which will be published. One of them is a Nobel Prize nominee and is quite well-known. (2 years)

\- Newspaper editor-in-chief, this one is pretty self-explanatory, but I will be running the school newspaper, which involves editing everyone's articles, raising money through advertising to fund our paper magazine, and I compete in a state competition and have a couple regional awards for my writing. (1 year as editor, 4 years as staff)

\- Best Buddies Peer Buddy and Event coordinator, School club, responsible for planning events, fostered relationships with special needs students, and help them apply for jobs. (4 years)

\-  Daycare Volunteer(Don't know what to name this one)- Give mini lessons once a month to 7-9 year old's about general health. We come up with a presentation and hands on activities for the kids and we have worked with the same daycare throughout

\-PCT student, through the career center at my school, I will be getting my PCT license and working with patients first hand. This is also a program you have to apply and get accepted to that my school district offers.

"Do colleges look at senior year grades?","I am wondering if colleges look at first trimester grades for senior year, as in junior year I had a low gpa (87.38). Does applying RD over EA or ED let colleges see your senior year first trimester grade? 

I had an upward trajectory from 9th (90.2) to 10th (93.8), but then came IB program and classes became harder, especially English.  Also if I was out of school during the week before finals for disciplinary reasons, how can I explain the impact it had on my finals. I have asked the school to not consider finals as part of my grade but they did not respond. I would have a 88.53 gpa if it weren't for the finals. Finally there was one course, English that I got a 76 in. How can I explain that?  I had a 91 and 93 for English respectively for 9th and 10th so a 76 in the third year just does not make sense. It is not like I did not try, but it was just that there was a ridiculously low amount of assignments and tests and I am not very good at writing essays or at oral presentations, which was the bulk of the grade. I have had problems with essay writing since 9th, with low grades on them. If I was good at essays, my English grade in 9th and 10th would be much higher; they were boosted by in class assignment and quizzes such as vocab quizzes and reading checks. But in 11th grade since IB program started there weren't any more vocab quizzes or reading comprehension assignments. 

I have a 1500 sat that I am retaking and hoping for at least a 1550.

I‚Äôm a bit lost on how to go about it. I already finished one semester at university, but I‚Äôm not sure how the credit transfer process works going from a university to a community college.

Has anyone here done this before? What was the process like for you? Any tips or things I should watch out for?

"Broke and overwhelmed","I recently graduated and am starting my first full-time job this week, it doesn‚Äôt pay much, but It‚Äôs still a position I‚Äôm excited about, and it‚Äôs the best I can get at the moment. 

I have exactly $10 in my bank account. For now, I‚Äôm staying in a small studio with a friend, but in two months, we‚Äôll need to move out and find separate places since we work in different locations.

Rent alone will be about half my salary, and while I was planning to buy a few work clothes next month with my first salary, it seems like that‚Äôs not going to happen because I need to save up as much as I can for moving out, I also made a financial plan, with a main goal of saving at least enough to live worry free, but now it feels impossible

I‚Äôve always been careful with money and had about three months‚Äô worth of savings, but it all went toward an unexpected emergency. I try not to spend on anything unnecessary, and it‚Äôs getting harder and harder.

I can‚Äôt ask anyone for money, I refuse to go into debt, and I‚Äôd rather go hungry than ask my parents for help. I‚Äôm trying to be grateful, some of my friends are dealing with worse, although this constant feeling of instability is so draining, and it‚Äôs starting to wear me down.

Does it ever get better?

"Question about Additional Info Section","I've been accepted into a pretty competitive course that's only for seniors in my high school, and I'm pretty sure it's only a thing at my school. It's basically a class where students do year-long projects that serve to better our school/community, as well as doing weekly school news videos, fundraising, putting on an annual talent show, and an annual event for local disabled kids.

  
My question is should I go into further detail about what this course is in the additional Information section of the Common App? Right now it's just listed in the courses section, and I'm worried that the schools I apply to won't know what it is.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mff1tr/question_about_additional_info_section/","1754101104.0","ApplyingToCollege","Aesops_fox9"
"Advice on sky high student loans?","I am going into my sophomore year of college as an electrical engineering major. I'm certain that engineering is what I'd like to do. I was set on attending a smaller Christian college as I really got involved in faith in high school (I was homeschooled, so youth group was a way for me to socialize). The problem is the college I'm attending, while it has a great engineering program, is expensive. It was $55K last year and is up to $58K this year. It's 4 hours from home so I can't save on room/board.

I had decent grades in high school (3.7 GPA) so got a fair bit of scholarships, about $20K per year. My mom makes about 1/3 of what my dad does so I had her file FAFSA, getting me another $17395 in grants/aid per year. On top of that I have federal subsidized student loans of $5500 per year (max amount I can have). Last year, I had a $12500 shortfall after all of those payment methods, and this year the shortfall is $15500. I used Sallie Mae last year to cover the shortfall. My mom co-signed and my interest rate was a whopping 16.5 percent (the highest rate they have). I've already accumulated $1300 in interest on it and I'm paying $50 a month.

I worked full time this summer, and in addition to the money I made working 2 jobs last summer, I've saved $11K. I'm planning on paying off my first semester tuition in cash this year ($7750) and only taking out a loan for second semester. I also got my first credit card and am building my own credit. I've looked at other lenders (College Ave, SoFi, etc) but they all have the same interest rate range (3-17 percent). I could get rates back from them before giving up though. The issue is my parents are in a lot of debt from their divorce and don't have great credit. I suggested federal Parent PLUS and credit Union loans to my mom, but she doesn't think she could be approved for any of those. Sallie Mae is all my mom thinks she can be approved for. She also doesn't think I should pay first semester in cash because I wouldn't have enough savings (I'd still have $4K, and will be working part time at school. I think it's enough bc I've already bought food, dorm supplies, a new laptop, books, and caught up on all the repairs for my car. Better than taking out more debt at 16%)!

any advice for me? Next summer I'll be getting a higher paying internship so could probably pay one more semester in cash after that. I could also refinance the loans I have when I build my credit more. But I'll Still have quite a bit of loans as I don't have any family help. The average starting salary for an electrical engineer in my area is $85K before taxes, which would only be about $65K take home. At 16% my student loan payments will be astronomical, and my overall goal is to move away on my own and be financially independent. Moving home to pay the loans off I don't want to be an option.

"Am I Making The Wrong Choice?","I am currently committed to USF as a kid from Wisconsin. UW Madison rejected me and was always my dream school. I got accepted into every UW school in the state but still chose USF because they had a decent stats program, and I wouldn't have to deal with the cold weather and depressing atmosphere of WI in winter. My initial choice of Madison would've cost me $140,544-$145,544 for 4 years including extra expenses, while my current school will cost me $116,192 - $120,192 for 4 years including extra expenses. I am constantly told by others that I am making a mistake and shouldn't go to college or to go to community college. I work a part time job where I make roughly $10k per year, and I have saved up roughly $25k already. My plan is to recieve funds/loans from my parents with no interest. They have told me I will pay for the 1st year by myself and go from there. The school has given me scholarships but I am worried everyone else is right and despite my plans to stay with my parents for a while and pay off school, I will still be broke and jobless. If you need more Information about my situation I'll try to provide it. I just don't want to dump my life story out here. Please let me know if you think I am screwed.

"Are 20s supposed to suck??","I just realized maybe I‚Äôm not the problem and life isn‚Äôt the problem. I used to think I was doing everything wrong. But maybe your 20s just suck? Cause everyone says 20s are the worst years. Like I‚Äôm thinking maybe I just need therapy for getting random periods of depression but maybe 20s are just depressing.

I‚Äôm in student debt. I‚Äôm in car debt. My job doesn‚Äôt pay enough to live on my own. Stuck with a processing job that I‚Äôm grateful for but there is 0 fulfillment. I feel like a freaking 40 year old coming home from work all tired and grumpy (no offense) not to mention my dream career is getting ruined by the second! (Public health)The cost of living sucks. I‚Äôm lonely. I have no friends. Have no idea what to do career wise. Still having trouble finding myself as a person, figuring out my dreams, passions, hobbies, and interests . No romantic interests. Literally sit at home after work and scroll. Feel stuck in a neighborhood & city I truly feel like I‚Äôve outgrown and kinda wanna see something new but scared to take a big risk with small resources but also small money. Constantly trying to keep up with the ‚Äúgood advice‚Äù in your 20s but only feel like I‚Äôm failing each time (like when people say max out your 401k, invest, don‚Äôt get into debt, work out, eat healthy) and then trying to find a balance to ‚Äúlive my best life‚Äù in my 20s and do a bunch of stuff but still have a small amount of money. Like I do have ‚Äúmoney‚Äù but I am very strict with my money cause I have this fear of losing it all and going broke. So the money I have isn‚Äôt spending money to me. Even though I‚Äôm living at home I‚Äôve fallen into the bill cycle (car payment, essentials, student loans) it‚Äôs not as much as others but still..I feel like my diet is trash even though I feel like I‚Äôm trying my best. Just hard on myself for everything & anything. I have to try hard to have fun. I have to try hard to relax my mind just goes. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm ambitious but sheesh my brain doesn‚Äôt get many breaks.

 But I also don‚Äôt wish to be a kid again. So many things happened that made me NEED independence. And I‚Äôm grateful to have ‚Äúsome‚Äù now. Things in fact that did not feel easier as a kid and feel easier now, now that I have more control over some things.

Just tired. People say ‚Äúoh it gets better‚Äù but why do I have to wait 10+ years for things to get better? I‚Äôm putting so much pressure on myself to go & be successful, build all these skills, get those jobs but it doesn‚Äôt even feel reachable in my early 20s.
---It‚Äôs so unfair..because I know my situation is unsustainable long term (cluttered, dirty, rodents, outgrew neighborhood, overall feel unhappy with condition of house)..yet I can‚Äôt do much about it at this moment. My parents had the opportunity to move when they went to college. They went to college and never came back home. One paid $300 in rent (split with roommate, overall $600).  Idk what she a was making at that time but I know it was way less than what I make now. With my job...I should‚Äôve been able to afford living on my own. Now I don‚Äôt have the best salary ever it‚Äôs still an entry level job..but it would‚Äôve been way easier to work if I had $600 rent  (including all utilities, safe neighborhood, no rodents). But now...rent would eat up my entire check.

It‚Äôs unfair. I know this environment is not sustainable long term. But the economy is not in my favor. I know how I felt living in DC/MD. I know it‚Äôd be different for me. But it is 10x harder to achieve. It obviously can be done since many people my age are doing it, but again it‚Äôs just harder to do.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mfgwiu/are_20s_supposed_to_suck/","1754106874.0","Adulting","Federal-Ad-4540"
"Using ChatGPT in the College Application Process","So my mom is using ChatGPT for college consulting and coming up with ideas for my essays. For example, she'll ask about how to list extracurriculars, which colleges require recommendation letters, how to structure an essay, etc. She has been using ChatGPT for a while to fix her grammar since her native language isn't English. I don't particularly mind when she uses it for those purposes, even though I'm aware of the environmental and social implications of AI. But I don't feel it's ethical to use AI in the college application process. For some reason, using AI to come up with ideas for essays feels wrong. My mom isn't using ChatGPT to completely write my essays or anything, but it still doesn't feel right. 

  
My mom does watch YouTube videos to learn more about the college application process, so it isn't like she's completely reliant on AI when it comes to college apps. However, I still don't know if I should use ideas from ChatGPT. I'm also worried about if colleges can sense if certain ideas are AI-generated. I might be a little paranoid here, but still.

"Advice needed","This is a really specific and odd situation but I would really appreciate advice. My college does this thing where they release the floor plans and residents in your building a little before the school year starts, so you're able to look at it and see who's in the other rooms. I just got the email and I found out that my room is right next to the room of this guy I have a pretty awkward relationship with (both rooms are singles). He's obviously had a crush on me for a while now, but we barely know each other and I could tell he was about to make a move but I ended up ghosting him out of my own discomfort. I know it was immature of me and I don't know how he feels about me ever since, but we've just continued as acquaintances and I say hi if I see him.

The thing is that we were on separate parts of campus before and now that we're right next to each other, I'm worried he might try to make a move again. And obviously it's not like I have to live with him, but I feel like it's going to be super awkward seeing him so frequently and him knowing I'm right next door.

"Applying to University in Australia","I‚Äôm not sure if this applies in this subreddit as I‚Äôm an Australian student but I feel as if this is general life advice I‚Äôm seeking. I‚Äôm a 12th grade student from Queensland Australia who needs to start putting in uni applications soon. I attempted the UCAT (clinical aptitude test to get into med school - provisional entry) but it didn‚Äôt go well so I‚Äôm trying to see what my next course of action should be. What I‚Äôm currently considering are: 
1. Apply to a biomedical science degree without provisional entry into medicine, do the GAMSAT, and try get in post-grad.
2. Apply to veterinary sciences (to become a veterinarian) 
3. Apply for a law degree.
However, each option comes with its pros and cons which I‚Äôd also like to go through.
I‚Äôd love to do medicine, helping people + saving lives and becoming the first doctor in my family. It also comes with good pay as a bonus. But, I‚Äôm not sure about doing an undergraduate degree that can practically be put to no use other than teaching if I don‚Äôt get into a post-graduate med degree.
I‚Äôve always wanted to be a vet - perhaps more than I want to do medicine. I love animals and this was my number one option, but I feel as if the debt and pay that comes with it isn‚Äôt proportionate to the amount of work I‚Äôd have to put into become a vet in the first place. 
Honestly, I just like debating which is why I ever considered law, and is also easier to get into than vet and med. But I‚Äôm not great at public speaking and it‚Äôs not even guaranteed that you‚Äôll actually get a job at a law firm despite having a law degree.
I feel like the Australian uni application process is different to Americans so this post might not make sense but I just need some help in considering which courses I should apply to üò≠.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mfid2c/applying_to_university_in_australia/","1754111669.0","ApplyingToCollege","lovinggkai"

"For anyone stuck in the weed/gaming/depression hole, you can get out.","I tracked almost everything while being on this journey I spent more than 627h hours since february on improving my life thats around 4hours per day, and that‚Äôs just the active doing stuff. All the passive mental work, reflections, mindset changes wasn‚Äôt even tracked. It all adds up over time. 

For the last few years my life was pretty messed up, after some hard past years I spiraled more and more into depression‚Ä¶ I slept till afternoon, ate junk, smoked weed and gamed all day.  

That lifestyle just made me even more depressed, I saw my friends succeeding, getting jobs, girlfriends, moving to new locations‚Ä¶ just being happy. That honestly made me even more sad, so I decided at the beginning of the year to turn my life around, because I thought I either I¬¥ll continue with this shitty lifestyle and eventually die feeling like I haven¬¥t done anything with my life or trying to get out of this shit and finally make my life worthwhile. 

I convinced a friend of mine to join the journey because he was like me, depressed, hopeless, smoking weed all day and just miserable. The first thing we did was starting to go outside more, running or doing some small workouts, sweating made me feel so much better, it was like I sweated all the toxins and bad energy out of my body. 

My buddy and I got a gym membership together and started going 5x to the gym every week. The negative was that we still smoked weed pretty heavily in the evenings, so 2 months ago we decided to also quit that shit as the next step, and what can I say. The last 2 months have been one of the best months, I finally sleep waay better with the new energy my workouts feel even better, I¬¥m more awake and honestly way more confident due to the achievements I made the last few months. 

Together we started looking for jobs and after 4 years of unemployment, I got a job at a garden center, which is pretty funny considering my old ""hobby"" was growing weed lol. My buddy got a job in logistics, and I even started to get in contact again with an old love I had when I was younger. If you're where I was, just start with one thing. Go for a walk with a buddy. You got this. 

This is just part of the story, I didn‚Äôt want the post to be too long . If you‚Äôre going through something similar or have questions, I‚Äôm happy to share more. 

TL;DR: Was a depressed, unemployed stoner wasting my life away. Started working out with a friend, then we both quit weed. Now we both have jobs, I'm dating someone, and I feel better than I have in years.","https://i.redd.it/gw9gkafvpkgf1.jpeg","1754126229.0","Adulting","Fair_Blueberry5907"

So neither of my parents went to college and they didn‚Äôt know much about how to navigate going. My school never helped me navigate it either. I'm in Texas and another student told me what apply Texas was. 

I'm 26 now and since I was 18 I've taken care of my special needs sibling. One semester I registered for a bunch of classes and would not have beem able to fulfill my obligation to them. I just had too much on my plate. I dropped all but one which made me have 4 out of 6 drops. I realized years later that if I would have dropped all of them and maybe spoken to someone at the school about my situation I would habe had 0 drops. In my head I continued with that class so I wouldn't have 5 drops. Is there anything I can do about it now? This was around 2021-2022.

I also just feel like a loser and too old for anyone to take me seriously in regards to an education. I always wanted to be a doctor. I feel like I'd never be able to do that because I have so far been inconsistent with going to college. Attending for a time and then stopping and starting up again later. I feel like I'm too old and will get looked down on. I feel like I couldn't get that advanced into the medical world because I attended a junior college and did not make straight A's.

I'm getting everything in order right now to set my sibling up to where I can get the time I need to actually attend school. I'd put my nose to the grindstone and try to get straight A's but I just feel ashamed and defeated and I have never had anyone to help me navigate college and support me because no one around me knows how to do it, I'm trying to learn myself.

\-Was outreach for a club called ISA(going to a new school so I can't keep that position)

Lowk this is all I can think of and it's really saddening because it's like left and right I see people just become like student officers for the district or some other niche club out of nowhere, and I'm just over here ""following the book"" by doing summer courses/aps but nothing else. It's not like I'm not trying to find opportunities near me, but almost every single application requires some sort of question like ""please list your extracurriculars"" and I have nothing. I have a few links that'll help with volunteering, but that's about it. If you guys have any advice I'd really wholeheartedly appreciate it on how to improve/find any extracurriculars! 

For ref I do not know what I want to major in so I feel like that will play a big role because technically I know that colleges don't want to see ""you all over the place"" in your applications.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mfamt9/sophomore_this_year_almost_no_extracurriculars/","1754088323.0","ApplyingToCollege","Longjumping-Paper791"

"Indian student aiming for US college ‚Äî but does the system even want me?","Hey everyone,
This might sound dramatic, but I‚Äôve been spiraling a bit and I just need to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm an Indian student taking a drop year, preparing for both NEET and SAT (yeah, juggling both, chaotic but necessary). My dream is to study in the US, hopefully something like biotech or biomedical sciences, and I‚Äôm working hard. But lately, I‚Äôve been haunted by this question:

Does the system even want me?

I mean, I‚Äôm not an American citizen. I wasn‚Äôt born with a blue passport or Ivy League legacy. I‚Äôm just a girl from a developing country, with very few jobs compared to how many people graduate, trying to beat insane odds. I keep hearing about how international students, especially from India, get the toughest time‚Äîhigher competition, barely any aid, and after graduation? Getting a job feels like climbing Mt. Everest in crocs.

Even if I do get into a good college (fingers crossed), I‚Äôll need to fight again for OPT, H1B, green card, and so on. And sometimes it just hits me‚Äîwhat if I do all this, get the degree, and still‚Ä¶ the doors won‚Äôt open? What if America only wants our money, not us?

It‚Äôs frustrating because I know I have potential. I know I can thrive if someone just gave me a chance. But some days, it feels like no matter how hard I try, the odds are pre-decided. Like they already picked the ‚Äúworthy‚Äù ones and forgot the rest of us who don‚Äôt have powerful passports or glowing grades from elite schools.

I guess I just want to know-
Has anyone here felt this? Gotten through it? Are there actually pathways that work for people like us? Or is this just a shiny dream and I should stick to the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù route my relatives keep nagging me about? It was the first time I chose my dreams ober anyone and it feels like I was never meant to dream.

Also, if any international students managed to build a life in the US after undergrad, please share your story. I need some hope right now.
Thanks for reading. Truly.

‚ÄîAn overthinking student with a passport, a plan, and a lot of self-doubt

"the competition is real and a few words of advice (yes ik its the same as the quadrillion posts every day like me but idc)","I'm starting college at an Ivy in a few weeks, and I know the common app just opened. I just wanted to say, some of these kids are truly out of the common persons stratosphere. Kids of billionaires and multi-millionaires, athletes who compete for their country at national competetions and win, students who represent their countries in things like olympiads and debating, actors in blockbuster movies and netflix shows, and students who have written award-winning books or won national art competitions. 

Those aren't the only people who get in though. I know someone who worked a job, participated in their family heavily, had some school-level ecs and beautiful essays and recs. My close friend whose also going to the same ivy didn't know how people applied to college till junior year and had random volunteering at different places and a ton of different sports out of passion as his only ecs. The competition on reddit is on average a bit better than the average student, but none of the true ""Oh they're gonna sweep the ivies"" students I know personally would be on reddit getting chanced. Worrying about how to phrase your application or maybe learning how to make a video for colleges like Uchi, washu, brown would be a much better use of your time.

Latly, prestige works in funny ways. I know a ton of people who sweeped HYPSM or the ivies or t20s or whatever going to the same college as me because it suits them better. You aren't going to make a more 'elite' network because you go to Dartmouth rather than Harvard.  A kid who beat me at the highest level our thing goes itw (think mock debate, essay writing) is going to University of South Carolina. 

I will not tell you prestige doesn't matter whatsoever LMAO. I'm sure I've cried about the difference between two ivies on this account before. Don't let it define your decision to ED to a school though. Anyone who tells you Stanford is a leg up on Duke or that Yale will open more doors than Penn or Brown is probably a fellow high schooler who's school idealizes whatever college they're busy glazing instead of actually working on their application.

I‚Äôm also still ranked top 2% in my class, I‚Äôm Hispanic, and the subject I got the low grades in (math) is one I am now excelling in since I got a 5 on calc BC after a B, and I‚Äôm now taking linear algebra after taking calculus 3 and getting all As.

I‚Äôve gotten all 5s and two 4s on AP

Current Stats: I have a 1570 SAT (790 Math, 780 reading) and I plan to study East Asian studies and Chinese in college (I‚Äôm hoping math grades don‚Äôt impact me horribly because of my major)

I have truly the top awards you can receive internationally for Chinese and East Asian studies, and all my ECs are high impact and correlate to my major. 

Do you think I still have a shot at T20??

"How do you find post bachelors programs? (Bio)","
Soo for context i have a BA in english/creative writing and somehow i ended up wanting to be a zoologist. Ive even considered vet school, but its going to be way too expensive since im in so much debt. I have a plan for myself career wise but thats not really what the post is about. Im very decisive and passionate about my career. 

Anyway, right now im working on gen eds at my local community college and i have no research experience. Biggest problem being, that they only really offer base level classes and they dont even have biochem or microbio ‚Ä¶ their stem department is exceptionally tiny and underfunded. I will most likely need higher level courses and its kind of hard to go to a university when a lot of them dont offer post bacc programs or second bachelors programs. 

Ive met a few people in vet school or in phd programs who have unrelated degrees and they went down a similar path, and they said they took a post bacc/pre professional program but a lot of those programs were cut thanks to our friends in DC. so i know its possible but ugh. 

I just have no idea where to go from here. It just sucks that i was pressured so hard to go to college before i knew what i wanted to do, and i had A LOT of mental illness that prevented me from functioning properly (mainly undiagnosed adhd). I was not passionate like i am now when i went to college before and im really regretting going at such a young age. (So parents, quit pressuring your kids.)

If we could suspend our nasty or judgmental thoughts on here that would be fantastic.

"UC Davis Question","I'm seriously reconsidering UC Davis as an option and would love honest input.

* **ROI:** According to recent data, the 10-year ROI is around $58K. Compared to other UC schools and private institutions, this seems pretty low. I‚Äôm worried about taking on debt for a return that might not be worth it.
* **Toxic faculty culture?** I came across a situation where a student was nearly suspended just for asking a faculty member a question they didn‚Äôt like. From what I‚Äôve heard and seen, some professors have serious egos and don‚Äôt respond well to being challenged or even questioned politely. That kind of environment sounds stifling and dangerous for growth.
* **Peer quality:** Honestly, from several campus visits and talking to students, the general impression I get is that a large number of students seem apathetic or just not serious. I‚Äôm worried that being surrounded by that kind of energy could actually slow me down or derail my motivation.

I‚Äôm not trying to hate‚Äîjust looking for real experiences and perspectives from current students, alumni, or anyone else who can give a fair take. Am I wrong to be this cautious?

"Deciding a major","It‚Äôs one of those nights I‚Äôm feeling particularly worried for my future after college so I take to reddit for someone to give me any ounce of advice. I am incredibly anxious about college and the major I choose and the life I‚Äôll live after college. The only things I really like doing are art related. Ceramics, painting, writing, ect., though I will certainly not major in arts because I want to make money. If I find a lucrative job, I‚Äôll have the money to pursue my passions. Right now I‚Äôm majoring in global health because I‚Äôm passionate about that, but I know it won‚Äôt make me any money so I plan on getting my MHA, which I actually like the idea of a lot. Should I switch to business for my MHA instead then? I do also see a lot of people dog on those who major in business, which is a little concerning. I‚Äôm also passionate about science, especially environmental sciences, but I also still worry I won‚Äôt make a lot of money. Plus, I‚Äôm not exactly good at math, I only really enjoy it when I understand what‚Äôs going on, and when I do, I really really enjoy it. 

I guess I want to enjoy my time in college, but really be sure that the decision I‚Äôm making is the right one. It feels like any decision I make is wrong. I know what I want my life to look like but I don‚Äôt know how to get there. I want to live comfortably, have time and money for things I enjoy, and not totally hate the job I have, or feel useless doing it.

"Speaking Out On My Shanghai International High School Experience (Tips at the very end)","[https://medium.com/@michaelyp66/speaking-out-on-my-shanghai-international-high-school-experience-tips-at-the-very-end-271e0456f89d](https://medium.com/@michaelyp66/speaking-out-on-my-shanghai-international-high-school-experience-tips-at-the-very-end-271e0456f89d)

I had recently graduated from a low tier international school in Shanghai and I wrote a medium article ranting on my experience as a student there. I will appreciate it if you can take the time to read it and share your thoughts üôè.

Or you can read it down here:

***Would you ever speak ill of a place that hailed you as a star?***

I had contemplated on this for a long time. Somedays I cherished my high school memories, on other days however, I loathed them.

After I returned to Shanghai from the United States, I wanted to go to a proper international school where I could prepare to study abroad. After months of searching and a disappointing semester at a low-tier boarding school, I finally found the place I thought I‚Äôd belong.

Then at the start of my sophomore year, my school relocated to the suburbs. The previous campus was too small, too dingy, and lackluster in terms of furnishing and facilities. The new campus sat aside a hill, and was surrounded by beautiful sceneries of nature. The school changed its name (due to a change in partnership), its logo, its theme color, and everything felt different. The campus was many times larger, and I thought I would be proud to graduate from here.

Three years later, months after I walked on the stage in my cap and gown, I realized I didn‚Äôt.

**Things began to go south**¬†during the second semester. The school was trying aggressively expand its student body, meaning its entrance exams were much easier than it should be. Every week a new face entered the building. Most of them transfered from Chinese schools because their grades suffered, some came from more prestigious international schools due to the immense pressure and competition, and a few came from overseas believing this is where they can continue receiving western-styled education (like me).

A great deal of those students came with bad habits. Smokers were very prevalent, even among the teachers. Many students who had never touched a cigarette before took up the habit here.

I saw my former best friend, who constantly made fun of smokers before, lined up with several others to receive his vape pods from the ‚Äúvape distributor‚Äù classmate. He also hailed from the US, and had been the smartest and best student of our grade. But gradually he drifted away to friends with unhealthy influences. He skipped classes, indulged himself in video games, and disappeared behind cigarette smoke in the dorms. His grades once leveled mine (we were the top two in out grade), but then took a dip. All of his habits had sabotaged him, and in the end he was rejected by his dream college.

I know such things like smoking exist at all schools, but the fact this is so normalized at my school became quite a nuisance.

Bad habits wasn‚Äôt the worse problem about the students, though. Many of them were immoral, carefree, and somewhat depraved. Every week or two someone was suspended. A classmate who I thought appeared normal was expelled when his sex tape was leaked. A week later someone left because they were distributing vapes. The worst thing, though, one of my classmates sold psychedelic drugs and he was never caught.

# Academics/College Counseling

In terms of academics, this school fell short in many ways. Many AP Classes failed to prepare the students for the actual exam, and most of the classmates (including me) resorted to institutions outside the school which charged an exorbitant amount.

The college counseling services were extremely inadequate. We were charged 100,000 RMB/14,000 USD if we wished to use it. Besides, the counselor provided only the most formulaic services. The essay templates were clich√©, the extracurricular competitions/activities were unoriginal and conventional. For example, every year the school would recommend students to participate in the CTB (China Thinks Big) competition where groups tackled societal problems through hands-on research and projects. However, when I asked a counselor outside of school, he told me CTB was just another unremarkable pay-to-win thing that does little help to differentiate you from other college applicants.

# Student Council Incident

In my senior year, though, things became worse. I was a part of the student council, and our supervising teacher was emotionally abusive and very manipulative. He graduated from an unexceptional university in the US (ranked around 970th in a list of top universities in the US) and came to China hoping to teach english-related subjects at international schools. Luckily, our school‚Äôs increasingly low hiring standards got him in. He constantly berated us of our shortcomings and reacted harshly whenever we made a mistake. When our halloween plans had gone slightly awry, he lashed out at all the student council members. He shouted at us on how incapable, incompetent, and utterly useless we were, even when we had poured all of our hearts out to the halloween prepraration. The result was a mental breakdown in one of the members and a 6 month withdrawal from school in another. He knew how to play the victim, and Mr. Nice guy when it was necessary. In fact, a lot of teachers in the school spoke highly of him and considered him a close friend because he was able to cover up his flaws with his charisma and vibrance.

Eventually we found out there was a mole in the council. The historian had been betraying all of us the whole time. He constantly spoke ill of us to the teachers, and tried to blame innocent members for things they did not do.

Eventually the several members of the student council, including me, got a classmate who‚Äôs very eloquent at writing to compose an impeachment letter and sent it to the school director, hoping she would sympathize with us and overthrow the supervising teacher. However, she gave the letters to the supervising teacher instead, and he called us into a meeting and denied everything bad we said about him in the letter (incidents of emotional abuse that were in fact, true).

While the StuCo President withdrew due to depression, the council needed a new president, and I was the likely candidate. During this time, however, the ‚Äúmole‚Äù began to target me for some reason, he told teachers and students that i wrote the letter, and shifted all the blame to me, when he had no proof. Crazy thing is, people actually began to doubt me, they really thought I was guilty in some way. It didn‚Äôt end there, though. In class, he mocked me at every chance given, ceased to converse with me, and continued to ostracize me until my graduation. I spoke out against him to the teachers, and the principal. In fact, about 5‚Äì6 of us went to the school director/trustees to inform her of how vicious the ‚Äúmole‚Äù was.

Of course, our pleas were ignored. After graduation I continued to follow up with the school, and I recently saw that the ‚Äúmole‚Äù is now elected president of next year‚Äôs student council.

***Wow. Just Wow***

He had been my friend for about a while, but after hearing that I was likely to become interim president he just switched up like that.

Ok, that‚Äôs enough about me ranting on the student council, a lot of this is personal grudge, but the fact there was such a lack of order when all of this happened was just¬†**disappointing**.

No one stepped in to help, no teachers cared about the students‚Äô mental health. Eventually the conflict died down, and the supervising teacher was removed from his position, but he grew increasingly resentful towards us, and we could feel the tension whenever he was present. Several of the student council members were traumatized by the student council drama. One student went to the hospital due to rapid heartbeat, another took up smoking to cope with the trauma. My parents even noted my deteriorating mental health during all of this.

Now that I think about it, some of this is child‚Äôs play, trivial school drama. But it really was as intense as I had described it. No such thing like this should happen at any school, but it did.

During my last months at this school, its marketing department asked me numerous times to speak at open-days and orientation events. I even got my own school interview that became somewhat viral on the school‚Äôs social media‚Äôs accounts. I had convinced several parents to put their children in this school, and the faculty applauded me on my contributions. Whenever the school filmed promotional videos, hosted events, and needed student speakers, I was the go-to guy.

For once, I felt proud, maybe I‚Äôm really helping the school become a better place.¬†**That cheerful thought, however, was soon subverted**.

An 8th grader who I convinced to transfer to this school at an open-day event was verbally and physically bullied within a few weeks of coming here. it all happened right in front of me. I watched him stand there helplessly as several people surrounded him and began to harass him. I couldn‚Äôt do anything, those bullies were my friends.

Now I feel guilty having to promote this school to the outside world. I had to constantly put on a happy face and tell people of only the good things about this school. Last month I had spoke at another orientation event, and I felt as if I had betrayed myself.

I graduated as the valedictorian, and in my commencement speech I lauded the school for transforming its students into brilliant and capable individuals.¬†**Yet I felt those were not my own words, it was only what the school wanted to hear.**

# My supportive classmates have also joined in to rant with me. Here are some things they said:

\[my school name\]is really mostly just pretending for the benefit of the school, becoming very hypocritical. In order to recruit more students, the quality of students has gotten worse year after year. Moreover, some courses are particularly easy; you don‚Äôt have to do much to get an A, and you don‚Äôt really learn much. The new principal came to straighten out the school‚Äôs rules, all in order to give the outside world the image that our school is very rule-abiding. The admissions office asked my friend to do an interview. My friend didn‚Äôt want to go, but they offered money for him to speak. Of course, he didn‚Äôt go in the end. They also put his work on the official account without permission. Everything is just to maintain the school‚Äôs image. The funniest thing is that the school promotes these eye-catching facilities like kayaking and such, but when we got here, there was nothing. It‚Äôs a scam.

# Final Thoughts

I‚Äôve been speaking against my mind for too long, so here I am, ranting about what had been suppressed but never said out loud.

I could‚Äôve left this school long ago. In fact, so many of my classmates, who were brilliant and capable individuals transferred to more prestigious schools. So many of my best friends left, they had encouraged me to do the same, but I didn‚Äôt, and when I really did tried to leave I realized it was too late, I was about to graduate from here soon so why not just stick with it.

Yes, the school did provide me with many benefits, there were brilliant young minds here, there were good people here. But there was so few of them, and plenty had been corrupted by the unhealthy environment. I‚Äôve talked to friends who went to more prestigious international schools such as¬†*YK Pao*,¬†*Shanghai American School*, and¬†*Pinghe*¬†and they‚Äôve noted little to no negative aspects about their schools, and they were quite surprised about the situation at my school.

There‚Äôs a dichotomy in me, one part wanting me to appreciate the good things the school had to offer, and the other wanting me to blame the school for all of its negativity. In the end, though the bad outweighs the good.

The school took in the good and the bad. In the end, a few of the good remained what they are, while the others leaned towards the bad.

If I were to evaluate myself on a scale of black to white, you could say I, along with many others, reside in the grey areas.

I don‚Äôt know what to say now. I don‚Äôt if the school will improve itself in the next few years. If I had to stay in that school for one more year I‚Äôm sure I would probably give in to all the negativity it has to offer, because my struggling self control will lose the battle against the desire to blend in.

The school hailed me a star, but I didn‚Äôt feel proud, not anymore. I spoke ill of it, so what? At least I spoke my mind this time.

"debating over questbridge vs normal application","ok please genuine question. tl;dr i qualify for questbridge but 1. idk if the application is conducive to me 2. worried about ""funding cuts"" affecting scholarships

in all terms i qualify for questbridge. heavily, have for a long time, but my parents always pushed away that truth of ""low-income"" (like as in ignored 50k+ in federal benefits) and i adopted that mindset, so i've never done any program that's like ""We encourage low socioeconomic"" because then i'd be ""found out"" (??)

i'm also always worried if universities are not gonna want to accept someone they have to give money for. from the viewpoint of ""they are a business"". also from the news about funding cuts so maybe they will accept less kids they have to pay full-rides for?

my question is, does it make sense to still apply through questbridge? if i've never done any of those programs, and that i probably don't have any significant ""stories"" about low-income other than ""oh i never got to go to $10,000 programs on daddy's money"" unless I'm suppressing some memories, and the business side of funding cuts maybe seeping into admissions and scholarship funding?

  
also because the questbridge application has only 4 awards spots and (in geniune) i have more than 4 very important ones, like considering mit has 10 in their's. and i have a lot of normal ""stories"" to talk about that aren't really low-income though i guess it could have come from that base of low-income?

  
help? thoughts on funding cuts seeping? thoughts on questbridge application being bad for me?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mgke6z/debating_over_questbridge_vs_normal_application/","1754230654.0","ApplyingToCollege","Agile_Isopod131"
"Why do Americans Romanticise Factory Work So Much?","I always wondered about this because a lot of Americans seem to miss Low Entry Jobs for people without Education or Trade Certifications being Manufacturing instead of Service. 

In my country we still have Low Level Manufacturing jobs but everyone sees it as Something you do for a while to afford College or whatever trade certificate you want, the only people who See it as a career are actually are people who come from ""troubled"" backgrounds from my experience. 

And honestly most Factories are suffering from a huge shortage simply because of how much people are avoiding it at all costs with half being filled with Foreign workers.

"I'm scared of college's grading system difficulty.","Hi, as the title says, I'm a freshman starting college in August.  I don't want to be unnecessarily pessimistic or sad about my situation, this is the start a new chapter of my life and overall I'm happy. My college uses the standard grade system (-A, A, +A). That basically means I need to do EVERY detail of my assignments perfect for a period of several months in order to graduate with a 4.0 GPA. I guess you have to plan every move carefully in order to not mess up any work achieved, right? However, I have never been an all A's grade student in Highschool. My average were B's. This summer I got rid of the factor I suspected didn't let me improve,  and now I feel a little more confident to say I may be great in college. But I'm not sure if this change in myself is enough for achieving a 4.0 GPA. This question has been haunting my mind the entire summer.

Is college that hard as most people say?  According to this grade system, getting an A in all classes during all semesters should be something miraculous that only happens to a select number of few prodigies, because a single detail could affect the entire score (Murphy's law). However, I saw in most forums claim that it's actually fair and possible: you just simply need to attend more classes and don't distract yourself with the social life. I have never been in college so I don't know how hard classes are. I'm not concerned for adding more study hours nor cutting my social life. In fact, I would set myself to any routine, no matter how strict is it, in order to achieve my goals. Still, I'm concerned if it's actually possible to achieve A's in all classes under a grading system like this.

But at the end of the day, it just feels so exhausting like I don‚Äôt even have the time or energy to invest in the things that bring me a joy. On my days off, I just wanna sleep, But the reality is I have to spend at least one day running all of my errands and then my second day off, I am too tired to make plans or socialize. I live in a place where I can‚Äôt really make friends because it‚Äôs a retirement community and it‚Äôs pretty isolated like physically. It‚Äôs a small town and I have to drive at least an hour to go get my groceries. But there‚Äôs no young people where I live and I‚Äôm in my mid 30s.

b) Professor - He has been traveling but I could send him a document with all the work ive done to help him with the LOR.

"Writing about trauma to help explain the context of.... me?","I am going to try not to trauma dump or anything but basically, growing up, I was not allowed to have any deep interests or really any at all, particularly outside the home. It was intensely controlling and unstable. I basically was not allowed to do any extracurricular activities (other than horseback riding 1x a week if that, no competitions/deep involvement allowed, and I had to give this up too due to financial contraints of my parents' divorce). I was put in an online charter school during COVID because my dad was controlling and a hypochondriac, which was very isolating and I struggled socially anyway due to undiagnosed autism & ADHD that no one cared about because of what a well-behaved young lady they thought I was. My parents split the summer before freshman year, we lived in a basement for a month, and I remained online freshman year. I only left the house to go horseback riding. I had no real way to get involved with much of anything. I got transferred into an in-person school literally 10 days before sophomore year began, got put in whatever classes they still had not filled, worked my butt off to get into AP junior year. Unfortunately, the social dilemma and my parents' ongoing issues prevented me from fully belonging. Junior year I tried to start a speech and debate club at school, but our assistant principal pulled permission for it being too ""similar"" to mock trial. 

I am completely at a loss as to what to even put on my extracurriculars section. I love to write and am trying to enter some competitions. I got a 5 on AP Lang, but for a lot of the schools I dreamed of going to that's expected. I am very worried that the above sounds like excuses, but I literally had no means of defying my parents and doing stuff before. I could not say no or argue with them about anything. I am not uninvolved because I'm not curious or creative, but I know that considering I'm up against people who created charities and have won science olympiads, that is a HARD sell. So nothing there. 

I have a part time job (only 6 hours a week though) and have little hobbies I do at home (writing, doing Simply Piano badly, drawing, learning Latin) but nothing to show for any of it. Honestly except for writing I can't even remember doing it. I mostly feel slightly happy when I play piano or draw for example and then zone out and totally leave my body. I can't even write about how my hobbies make me feel lol, because I don't feel anything. 

  
\*TLDR:\* I guess what I'm trying to ask is, where do I go from here in putting together my application and essays? How do I present this without coming across as a victim while still helping admissions to understand that I have been trying my best with my situation?

"Is it worth a mid degree and career swap to engineering? Possibly going for second bachelor's after graduating?","**TLDR:** Just graduated with associates, enrolled in Bachelor's program for Organizational Management: Public Administration.  Considering going to different school for engineering, or to finish bio degree.  Will need significant prereqs, on classes whose prereqs I haven't taken since 2010, totaling an additional 3 semesters before I could start my bachelors in engineering(30-40 credit hours.) Some issues with financial aid taking these classes locally as I already graduated with associates.  Considering finishing Bachelors OM, then getting masters; OR doing prerequisites and doing Engineering/Biology; OR finishing Bachelors in Organizational Management then getting second bachelor's in Engineering or Biology. 



So I was a bio major, ended up leaving school for about a decade, worked in management and construction and recently graduated with my associates and am continuing on with a bachelors in Organizational Management: Public Administration.  I have work experience being a supervisor, a project manager, service manager in food and beverage, construction and water/fire/mold mitigation, as well as several professional certs and licenses.  

  
I'm just... not sold on the major.  At all. Most of the classes seem pretty easy and straight forward.  Management was one of the higher careers on multiple personality and career tests I have taken.  I find the topics simple, and mostly things I have already learned how to do over the past decade.  I am also going to a community turned state college, so most of the students are rather unserious and it's a small campus.  

  
Engineering was actually the highest rated career for me, leaning towards civil and environmental engineering(I was also tying to do environmental sciences with my bio degree.)  Biology is also still a possibility.  The problem I run into is for engineering, I need between 34-40 additional credit hours to get my bachelors depending on what the university will let me transfer(I have some classes, but not the state required like ""stats for engineers,"" while I have basic stats.  The dean may let me transfer some to fulfill prereqs tho.)  I also run into issues being that I have already graduated with my associates, so financial aid will be iffy to cover those at the local college.  Biology I could probably get all my prereqs knocked out by beginning of next summer. Engineering has many math and science based classes I will need to refresh on algebra geometry and precalc, classes I haven't taken in over a decade.  Classes would be Stats for engineers, Calc 1- and a few other assorted 1-3 credit classes that are part of the state requirements for engineers.  

  
Part of me wants to just graduate, maybe go back for a masters in logistics or MBA, or a second bachelors in bio.  I guess I am looking for advice.  

  
Should I suck it up and just go math, chemistry and physics heavy the next three semesters go for engineering? Or wrap up what I've started, and get a masters or second degree? I feel engineering will be a more fulfilling career, but I am already sitting with 10+ years experience invested in management(which will help in basically any career path.) I also think management has a lot more possibilities to explore and I could really get niche with my work history depending on where I take my masters.  Or even finish the bachelor's and get a second engineering degree.  I have no problem with additional schooling, I am just worried about putting in effort and then realizing I hate the career as I graduate.

I feel like I'd stand out more, have more access to research, and build closer relationships with professors for LORs.

But here‚Äôs the problem: my parents won‚Äôt pay for private school. That means I‚Äôd have to take out loans‚Äî*a lot*¬†of them. We‚Äôre talking $200k+ just for undergrad alone. Add that to med school (which I know can easily cost $300k+), and I‚Äôm looking at potentially¬†*$600k+ in debt*. That‚Äôs terrifying, especially knowing how little I‚Äôd make during residency.

I got a 730 on R&W (aiming higher on retake) but scored far below state average on math (480; I know it‚Äôs terrible, I have dyscalculia and really tried my best and aiming for at least a 500 next time). I also signed up to be a SAT R&W tutor for schoolhouse so it‚Äôd look suspicious if I didn‚Äôt submit test scores. I‚Äôve been really stressed about this and just don‚Äôt see myself doing well on the next test. I did like 4 hours of tutoring a week in the months leading up to the SAT but I STILL bombed the math portion and it‚Äôs just unfair. I want to go somewhere good :( 

once again I ask that nobody poke fun at my math score in the comments. I understand this subreddit is full of very high achievers so my score may seem extra egregious but I'm really aiming for better next time. but I also understand that I have to be realistic and I'm probably never going to get above like a 550","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1mh124n/test_optional/","1754272727.0","ApplyingToCollege","fionappletart"

"Overwhelmed with being an adult and it's such a spiral...","Hey...
How do you people deal with everyday life? 
To me the regular life (going to work, paying bills, constant cleaning, etc) is already so much, that I today kind of lost it lol
My doctor says I have very low blood pressure, maybe that's why I'm feeling barely alive.

Are you all also stressed about doing all chores, working out, meeting people + needing to have a life on the side?
I've been single for about a year and I can't fathom how a second person would even be able to enter my life if I don't even have time for my own thoughts. 
So I'm in a doom spiral of never ending chores and responsibilities.

It's like I finish work,  then there is a complete blackout of my mind and suddenly it's  the next day and I'm at work again. Day in day out. 
Where is life? This can't be it. 
I'm just one person, how do people with kids not go under? Lol

I'm really melting right now ü´† 
Talked to my friend, but they don't seem to have this problem, so If you do have this problem, did you manage to regulate yourself? 

PS: I don't watch TV or video games, no time. 
So where is my time going?  Chores, work,bills,appointments,more chores.
I cannot more lol

So when I was applying to that high school, she altered my transcript to not include any advance english/math courses I took, which by the high schools course book would have placed me on a honors/ap track rather than the one I am on now.

"High academics w/o impact ECs","Hey, I‚Äôm new to Reddit so please be forgiving if I mess something up üò≠ I‚Äôm stressed out for a couple of reasons. But first, some information about me:

Intended major: bioinformatics/comp. Bio (was always going to be CS or engineering, but I pivoted last minute)

I‚Äôm white, living in rural area, high income, non-first gen

I got a 1460 SAT and 32 ACT. I have maxed out the rigor at my school and have gotten 4s and 5s on my AP exams (majority of 5s). I have a 4.0 UW/4.8 W GPA (even with max rigor, I‚Äôve managed to maintain all As).

For the sake of this discussion, imagine my testing scores being 1500+ SAT and 34 ACT (about where I‚Äôm gonna end up with Aug. and Sept. retake respectively).

Now, whilst my academics are stellar, my application hinders when it comes to ECs. 

ECs: Robotics, knowledge of some programming languages, Model UN, Orchestra (w/ Honors), founder of book club, w/ some others I cannot remember right now.

Awards: AP Scholar w/ Distinction, Rural/Small town award (Collegeboard), Spanish Honor Society, Seal of Biliteracy. 

It‚Äôs not as if my ECs are nonexistent but rather that they pale in comparison to everyone else (I think). My school is higher-end compared to many schools in [rural state], yet there are some opportunities I missed out on (a lot of it came down to social anxiety issues.)

So my question is: what schools should I aim for? Am I worthy of T20 schools or should I be more realistic reaching for schools like UIUC or UMD?

"Should I start college at Tulane this fall‚Ä¶ or wait until Spring 2026 for a better fit?","I graduated high school in 2023. I didn‚Äôt plan to take time off, in fact, I was excited to start college. But life changed fast.


In the fall of 2023, my best friend, basically my brother, took his own life. We‚Äôd been inseparable since we were six. We had dreams of going to college together, working in finance, and building something meaningful side by side. His death broke me. I wasn‚Äôt in any shape mentally to go off to college a month later and pretend everything was okay.

Around the same time, my mom‚Äôs stage 4 breast cancer came back. It had already spread to her liver, bones, and breast, and later, in 2025, it metastasized. She had to undergo surgery and surgery this summer, and the recovery has been brutal. We‚Äôve been through multiple near-death scares. She‚Äôs slowly getting better now, but it‚Äôs still a long road.

My dad lost his job too, so I became the one helping pay bills, taking my siblings to appointments, managing the house, and supporting my mom emotionally and physically. I‚Äôve worked jobs, internships, and volunteered during this time. I‚Äôve also grown a lot, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally.

I was accepted to Tulane for Fall 2025. It‚Äôs a good school and I‚Äôm grateful, but part of me is wondering if I should defer and start college in Spring 2026, maybe at a different school that aligns better with my mindset, growth, and future goals. Or worse case have Tulane in Spring as my Plan B. 

I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs smartest. I want to go to college, badly, but I also don‚Äôt want to force myself to start something that doesn‚Äôt feel fully right, especially after everything I‚Äôve gone through. My mom is slowly getting better, but I‚Äôm her main support. Emotionally, I feel like I could be ready by Spring. Logistically, I could go now. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll regret waiting, or rushing. I just don‚Äôt want to get screwed again or something happens in Jan and I have to wait even longer. Idk what to do at all. I also am worrying about being 2 in a half years behind if I defer because I really want to have the college experience and make best friends, get a good education, party, have fun, meet a wife, and just be on my own. But Ik being a spring admit makes all that way harder than going in the Fall. I‚Äôm not sure what the best move is but I have to know by Tomorrow. I would wait another year but then it‚Äôs just three years behind and wasting this opportunity so I‚Äôm trying to decide what the best move is. I would love anyone‚Äôs advice please.

"How do you guys get ready in the morning without feeling dread and wanting to throw up","School mornings makes my anxiety skyrocket, I‚Äôll throw up anything whether I have an empty stomach or not‚Äîusually I‚Äôll skip breakfast because I can‚Äôt digest food since it‚Äôs early, and it sucks because it‚Äôs feels like I‚Äôm sick everyday from just waking up to go to school. What I noticed though is that I usually feel better after 10am, it‚Äôs just the mornings. I have to wake up at 6 and it makes it even worse. I also ALWAYS feel exhausted even though I get 8-10 hours of sleep. I think I get enough.

Another thing that probably contributes to it is how my body has bad stamina and I‚Äôm not physically strong. My legs always feel weak, I feel like I‚Äôm weaker than most people because I can‚Äôt run for that long or even walk without feeling horrible. I‚Äôm not the worst athletically, but I get tired so easily. I did the pacer test and I threw up after it.. I didn‚Äôt even do that much laps, 9/10 chance I‚Äôll throw up each time. It‚Äôs hard to work out though because I don‚Äôt have much equipment for that and my apartment is small, I can‚Äôt drive either since I‚Äôm home alone most of the time. I like volleyball but peppering even gets me tired, I also suck at it. Because of that I can‚Äôt join any sports clubs but I want to

"How can I help my daughter start narrowing down schools to look at?","My daughter is a junior. Life and plans changed for her this year when she had to make the decision to quit her lifelong sport she hoped to do in university because of injury (she wasn't going to be a collegiate athlete, but she was an all star cheerleader who wanted to be close to a big gym). So, now instead of staying close to certain areas, the whole world has opened up and she is overwhelmed. I'm trying to lead with figuring out which areas of the country she might want to try and she just has decided since she hasn't been to all 50 states she can't possibly decide if she'd like it. Even the 25+ she's been to were often for sports or a quick visit so how can she judge. So we're just looking for a gentle way to start. I also recognize she is grieving her plans she had and want to be sensitive. She has a 4.0UW and is starting dual enrollment this year. She has quite a few ECs, and does do some other athletics now, so definitely not a case of a kid who isn't ready or doesn't want to go. She's just looking at the many many schools out there and having no idea where to begin. I really don't want to stress her out more. What can i do to help her without being pushy?

Earlier this year back in february we had the option to continue doing IB or drop it and go traditional or do a different program, like dual enrollment. I hated pre-ib, it was hell and I was suffering so as soon as I heard I could drop it, I submitted the paperwork, met with the counselor with my dad and got unenrolled from it. So then about a month later I signed up for dual enrollment. I wanted to go full time, but I still had 2 credits I needed to stay at my high school campus for so I decided to do half of my classes on my high school campus and half of them at my local college. I met with the counselor and we made my schedule TOGETHER. She wrote the classes down and told me that, that schedule will work and I should take a summer class. I said okay and submitted the paperwork to take a summer class THE DAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE. A few weeks go by and I wonder why I haven‚Äôt been approved for my summer class and it turns out that my guidance counselor submitted it after the deadline so I wasn‚Äôt able to take the class. I‚Äôve heard of other kids talking about how she‚Äôs screwed them over with dual enrollment stuff but I didn‚Äôt think it was me.

\--------------

""this is an example paragraph im just typing and using this as an example and im about to be done with thise pargraph and move onto the next one.""



""this is the next paragraph and as you can see I pressed enter twice after the previous paragraph so there would be a line of white space in between each paragraph and yea you get the gist.""

\-----------

That is how I formatted my original essay. However, I pasted it into the common app submission box and it deletes all the spaces between my paragraphs. So the question is: do I go in and add back the spaces between paragraphs or not?

Also, did anyone else have a bunch of small paragraphs that were maybe 2-3 sentences long (kind of like how a regular chapter book is). After reading the college essay bible or wtv, it made me think I had to be ""experimental,"" so I did basically the opposite of the normal classroom essay format. I mean the structure was pretty much the same as in - 1. anecdote/attention grabber 2. transition to introduction for challenge/obstacle 3. how you overcame it 4. how it changed you/affected you and what you learned 5. conclusion/closing sentence(s).

* Local nonprofit tutoring organization board member/data manager, update/manage the nonprofit's database
* Science Bowl participant, main team won regionals but we have 3 teams and I was on a lower team that didn't win bc im kinda butt

* Played on school ping pong team, mostly for fun
* Mandarin Club Treasurer this coming schoolyear, we meet once a month & we just have fun doing things like watching movies/cooking
* Gym 4-5 times a week with big bro
* Did a month SAT tutoring for free through Schoolhouse for abt 25 hours total
* Came back to XC this year since I stopped after being pretty good in middle school, I was super slow and will not doing it next yearüëç

Some questions:

* Is there anything I should do in terms of economics? I feel like applying to UC is very competitive and I don't really do anything related to econ but I'm not sure where to start, especially since I'm not even taking my school's econ class until senior year
* Should I retake the SAT? My first time taking it was on a whim and I didn't really study, I could get a higher score but I don't know if it's necessary. Also taking an ACT through school this year so I might not need to anyways
* If I don't make AIME am I cooked? I see at least like 3 other people in my grade that are 2x aime qual and two of them made usamo/jmo, they're too smart fr
* I fumbled pretty hard freshman year, didn't really do hw like a fool and I missed A- cutoff by around 0.03% in english and math both semesters (I didn't get rounded üò≠) so compared to some of my friends my gpa is a lil low. locked in sophomore year though üòº so do colleges care abt freshman year if I do well junior and senior year?

I'm pretty interested in CS and Economics, aiming for schools like UIUC and UChicago since I live in Illinois.  I've been to UIUC and UC for several events and I really like them both a lot, so I really want to go for the respective majors (something like cs+math at uiuc or econ with cs at chicago).

In terms of ecs, I feel like everything I do is pretty random and all over the place, but I enjoy them all a lot. I'm just worried that my schedule might be too full now and I should cut some of it out, along with how I feel like a bit of a fraud in the leadership positions I'm going into.

i‚Äôve only tried four different medications to help, but each time it has had some pretty severe lasting consequences on my mental health and no improvement 

it gets worse with stress so since i‚Äôm worried about school i can‚Äôt sleep, i‚Äôm getting in barely a meal a day and i‚Äôm losing a lot of hair

i feel absolutely awful about starting school at such a low point but it gets worse every year and god knows if i‚Äôll ever have the motivation to even consider going again 

i want to try to help it in some way before i start or even as i start, but i can‚Äôt handle another two week long episode from another failed medication

"Can't decide what to put on the activities section of the common app - help!","I'm planning to major in Bio on a pre-vet track, with hopeful minors in English and French. While my academics are pretty decent (97.1 uw, 1430, retaking again Aug) my ECs are all kind of mid to low level. I certainly haven't been doing any research with any professors lol. All of my ECs have been done because I have a genuine interest and enjoyment in them. However, because most of my ECs are the same mid level Im struggling to decide what exactly I should put on my application, and if I should sub-in hobbies to more accurately represent me as a person!



What I currently have:

1) The cat rescue I volunteer with and foster through (10,11,12, 2/52)

2) The non-profit bookstore I volunteer with and founded a YA book club in (10,11,12, 4/40)

3) The in-school book club that I was elected council member of, and am currently co-president of (9,10,11,12, 5/9)

4) Content editor for the school's litmag (11,12,4/2)

5) Shadowing with a vet (12, TBD)

6) The cat rescue I crochet cat toys for, for fundraising purposes (11,12,10/7(or TBD))

7) The precollege Vet Med program I went to this summer

8) Dungeons and Dragons (in school club + independent hobby, 9,10,11,12, TBD)

9) I'm part of a group writing the fall play for the school

10) Volunteer work taking care of farm animals at farm attached to non-profit kids summer camp (I really only did this for like a week Freshman year, but I included it bc most of my other stuff starts Soph year)



The plan was to hopefully have my hobbies show through my ECs (for example, not having to put down reading as my hobby because you can see that I run two bookclubs + the bookstore), but I'm worried now that its not clear enough.¬†



An understanding that my main hobby is reading is vital to understanding who I am as a person, so should I be specifically making sure that it's known? Is it clear that I do art and crochet as hobbies because you can see that through my fundraising for the cat rescue, or should I make it more explicit? Additionally, should I put the one paid job I did down (seasonal employee at Barnes and Noble), since everything else is just volunteering? Does it look like I just wasn't employed lol.¬†



Also what about writing! Is it clear that it‚Äôs a hobby of mine through the content editing + collaborating on the play, or should I say it directly.¬† I saw someone on the sub recently talking about putting down that they write fanfiction and getting into Stanford. I typically write more orginal works, but I mean....¬† Also I am a huge theater fan, grew up near NYC, see about 12 shows a year, collect playbils, big fanatic, but I have no real talent in it and quit stage crew so I don't know how to put that on my application. Still, I feel like you don't really know me unless you know of my love of musicals. How can I get that across?



I guess I'm just stressing and am wondering what the best thing to focus on is, and am especially in need of help from someone¬† who hasn't been staring at this for hours. I want to make sure I come across as a real person, doing things I'm passionate in, not for college apps (because I am.)

"I Feel Like A Failure","I just got out of taking my final exams this year. I'm only in my second semester for my Mechanical Engineering degree and I don't think I did very well on them. I currently have As in all three of my classes but I think I might drop to Bs in two of them after today and I just feel like shit.

I took more credits than recommended for the 10 week summer course, with 12 credits. I also have a 2 year old I'm taking care of at home and work 30ish hours per week at my job. I only took so much on to try and keep on track to finish my degree in 4ish years. 

I don't have much time to study, maybe averaging 12ish hours a week which is just enough to get my schoolwork turned in. Because of this I have a basic understanding of everything but have not had time to work on more difficult concepts that I am not 100% on. Yesterday I called in some favors for childcare and managed to work for about 14 hours, largely to complete my English final paper and my last Chemistry work, but even then I didn't get much extra time to study. 

My wife works opposite of my time because we can't afford childcare where we live. My parents were my original childcare option, but in the last few months my father had a stroke and my mother had to get kidney surgery so they haven't been in a position to care for her. I've tried to fill in my free time at school and work when I have breaks to do work but the days I do have meant the next day I've been ill from not resting. I already don't sleep very well, but I haven't had a chance to visit a pulmonologist to see why even though my primary care doctor has recommended it. 

If I got Bs in two classes like I think I might that would drop my GPA to 3.68. I just feel like I'm failing my wife and daughter. I want to lie down in the street and die. I don't want to extend my school forever because I don't want my daughter to have to live in a tiny apartment with hand-me down clothes for her entire childhood. I want to give her a good of a life as I can as quickly as I can. But at the same time I am just frustrated that I can't seem to push myself harder. I want to do more, I just can't figure out how to make the time for it. I feel lazy, yet all I do is work. 

I've taken a week of vacation from work starting today now that I'm also out of school. I've invited my friends over a couple days and am gonna try to watch some movies and play some games and get out. I don't see my friends or do hobbies while I'm in school, so it will be nice to have that for a week at least before getting back to school and the fall semester.

"Starting to have second thoughts","Im an incoming college freshman, Im double majoring in jazz studies and music education, I did enough college credit plus and AP classes in high school to where a lot of my gen eds are covered, so the double major isnt actually that bad in terms of course work. My move in date is two weeks from tomorrow. I love music, but I got the bill for school and Im having serious second thoughts. If I do this, Ill do what I love, but Ill never be in a good financial situation. I knew that already, but looking at the actual numbers now is really starting to weigh on me.

Meanwhile, I currently work at Starbucks. Starbucks allows you to attend ASU completely for free. I could easily just drop music as a career, live with my parents for a couple more years while I work full time at Starbucks, enroll in ASU online, and get a free degree in accounting or something, where Ill make good money and have decent savings, all while being debt free.

Maybe Im just scared for this big upcoming change, but Im not sure what to do anymore. I love music, I really do, and no matter what job I have I absolutely will do music anyway because it really is my main passion. Being able to support myself from just music has always been a dream, but Im just not sure if I should try that and potentially fail extremely hard, or if I should just drop it, play it safe, and do something I know I can be financially successful at. Im scared to commit to one or the other and dont know what to do.

"45 and never dated, starting to think I never will.","I tried asking out a woman I've seen and talked with the at the gym for the past month and she turned me down. I'm not too broken up at the rejection itself, at this point it's rejection 100,234 and I'm used to it, but it highlights the biggest issue with being a virgin: It's demonstrable proof that you are unable to form the connections other people can to enter into intimacy.

I'm long passed the point of caring about whatever society thinks about being a virgin and if I'm being honest, I kind of don't care about sex, at least as an immediate thing. I can't miss what I never had but I do know I have physiological issues that come from touch starvation and those issues are greatly alleviated whenever I hug a woman, and that small connection is something I crave, something to expand upon and I'm confident sex will happen eventually, but that connection has to be established first.

I'm 6'6 and muscular and everyone tells me I'm basically a cheat code for dating but it's never done anything for me. I was an awkward, socially ostracized fat kid who became a virtual pariah as an adult due to obesity. I was over 500lbs at my heaviest, I genuinely scared or disgusted women. I fear I lost the weight too late in life as at this point, the rejections are much better! I don't get threatened to have the cops called or told soul crushing rejections anymore, it's mostly just women not really interested in dating due to past bad experiences or various life stressors that made them less social in their 40s. And I have no experience, I don't know what to say to convince them otherwise or how to navigate even finding someone that might be amicable towards it.

I'm also worried about how things like social exclusion, porn and just living life never having experienced basic human companionship have set my mind to think differently from most other people, that I'll be unrelatable. It's a terrible situation, sometimes I wish I were asexual just so I wouldn't be bothered by biological urges like I am.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mhs3hv/45_and_never_dated_starting_to_think_i_never_will/","1754347034.0","Adulting","MegaDriveCDX"
"No woman ever cucked tech bros the way tech companies just did","


Tech companies literally screwed over tech workers. They lured them into tech by saying they needed software engineers. People invested years into studying software engineering. They made them believe open source was a common goal and a noble idea, so they built open source projects for free and big tech used them without paying a cent. Then they trained AI on that code. And now? They lay off engineers and replace them with AI. Web development, according to a recent Microsoft report, is high on the list to be automated by AI.

These companies perfectly tricked autistic nerds who love coding, people who live and breathe it 24/7, without ever asking themselves how to protect the value or copyright of their work.

Now the Nvidia CEO and Zuckerberg are openly telling tech workers that software will be written by AI and mid-level engineers will be replaced?

Are tech workers really going to submissively accept that they‚Äôve been brutally cheated? No woman ever cheated on or cucked them the way tech companies just did. Computer science grads now face unemployment rates close to those of art majors.

So, would you still contribute to open source and share your solutions for free just so tech companies can profit off your work?

Do tech workers learn a lesson and somehow unite to protect themselves from big tech? Do they rethink the whole idea of open source? Do they redefine their agenda?

Do they condemn those among themselves who create tools that write code for programmers and sell them cheap to corporations? Do they ostracize devs who try to bury their fellow software engineers by building startups like Devin, which promises to write code for less money and replace programmers?

Why are they so eager to build tools that speed up coding, but so few of them stand up against AI and build tools that actually protect software engineers and the copyright of their work?

Why do these CEOs say they'll replace engineers with AI and tech workers do nothing? Why, when big corporations lay off people, do they just sit back? These companies treat tech workers like a piece of shit after years of building their software, and tech workers still do nothing. They believe they won‚Äôt be affected or that AI will somehow benefit them.


This is a humiliating truth you‚Äôre too scared and ashamed to face. It's finally time to admit that you‚Äôve been cucked. Lured into studying a demanding field, only to be replaced and thrown away like trash.

All of you are like: nah, AI won‚Äôt replace me, AI is stupid, AI is Another Indian! Hahahaha!

 Denial syndrome. Get real. You‚Äôre not special. You‚Äôre just a copy-paste resource.You‚Äôre not a software engineer you‚Äôre a resource that costs the company money, so they optimize you with AI. And you still believe you‚Äôre special and you won't be affected by layoffs.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1mhskcg/no_woman_ever_cucked_tech_bros_the_way_tech/","1754348206.0","GenZ","FantasticEffect10"

We got two water-filling stations about at two local hot spots. Whilst I‚Äôm really proud of this and it does look really good for my application, I‚Äôm worried of a couple things:

1. This was in 8th grade and was part of a class-wide science project. I‚Äôm worried because A. Common App doesn‚Äôt let you mark ECs as prior to HS and B. whilst there were definitely hours put outside of school, a good majority of the work was done in class. 

2. We tried to start it up again in 9th grade but it fell through due to various reasons. How do I address what happened? I feel like seeing such a successful project go through shows a lack of consistency. 

3. I‚Äôm not sure it really fits my major. I want to go into Bioinformatics/ Comp. Bio. Granted, my application is very much well rounded without any really apparent interest (pretty big problem) but it still feels off. However, this is definitely one of my top activities if I could include.

"rant/ 22 & navigating moving home after college, nuanced financial situation, & a new queer relationship","i wanna start this off by saying i am extremely fortunate and recognize the privilege it is to grow up in a household with two parents who were/are relatively financially stable during my childhood and even more so now. i grew up in a suburb close to the city, and though it was a short distance from the city, it has a very small-town feel. pretty conservative area, it took me longer than most to take off the mask i had created to fit into my environment at school and home. it was very hard for me to be myself, i had no sense of self-identity, and i eventually became really depressed which worsened until i addressed all of this, started to explore myself, and came into my queerness with the help of close friends. i grew up quite sheltered which i hadn't really realized until the end of high school/beginning of college. 

i always described my family as ""dead-center middle class."" sometimes living paycheck to paycheck, though they actively tried to keep me out of any conversation involving finances, even now still, there were definitely times it was hard for them to get by. but we always had food on the table and as i've gotten older my dad has been promoted multiple times at his job, and he now makes around 90-100k a year. my mom makes somewhere between 20-40k a year. so def more like upper-middle class, at least now. we've almost always went on yearly vacations, my parents each own (nice) used cars, and also purchased me a used car to get to & from school. my mom grew up poor, so her attitude towards money has always been quite frugal: thrift anything possible, grocery shop carefully with coupons to get the best prices, pretty strict budgeting. she made it a point that she never wanted us to experience things that she had. in order to go to college, my parents made too much to qualify for significant financial aid, but not enough to actually afford my education (i had a sibling in college at the same time as me), so i took out what totaled around 25k in federal loans and 60k in private loans. 

my parents have been helping me pay interest on my loans and will continue to do so, but the rest falls on me (though they're willing to help out if i can't make payments, so i don't default). i am very thankful for this because otherwise my situation would be a lot worse. that being said, with my college major (visual art) and the current job market, it's not looking great for me. i have a shitty part-time job rn but it is obviously not enough to be able to afford rent and my loan payments, plus other necessities, so i have to move home until i find something full-time that pays at least $20/hr. i feel a lot of dread and fear about this.

my financial situation is confusing for me to be in, because i can't afford to live on my own and i live quite frugally, but i do have support and a safety net. i just entered a relationship where my partner does not, at least not to the same extent as i. i've expressed that i can't afford rent right now so im moving home, that i have significant burdensome doubt that will take 10+ years to get rid of, etc, but am worried that my attitude towards money will come off as disingenuous and pretending-to-be-poor once they realize my family is upper middle class, though definitely not with generational wealth. family stuff is complicated being queer. i love my family, i am thankful for their support, but i don't feel myself at home. they tell me that they want me to be comfortable, but it doesn't feel true. there's always this unspoken pressure in to remain close to the status-quo. it's like their support comes with conditions: and in those conditions i don't feel like i can be myself. i grew up in a big family, am autistic, and for much of my earlier life struggled to make friends. for a while family was the only sort of community i knew.

my parents aren't awful by any means, i love them, i'm just worried living at home will ignite this old version of me that i hate so much and that i will relapse, and/or that my partner will not like my family (or that my family won't like them). it's a new relationship and i've never been in a serious relationship before. i'm 22. living at home makes me feel like i lose autonomy, and im worried my partner will sense this and this will change how they view me. i would appreciate any thoughts/words of wisdom/similar stories, i just feel really lost and dreadful about the future, and about these two worlds of mine colliding. i don't exactly know what i want or where my life is going, but im trying, and i really like this person.

i always described my family as ""dead-center middle class."" sometimes living paycheck to paycheck, though they actively tried to keep me out of any conversation involving finances, even now still, there were definitely times it was hard for them to get by. but we always had food on the table and as i've gotten older my dad has been promoted multiple times at his job, and he now makes around 90-100k a year. my mom makes somewhere between 20-40k a year. so def more like upper-middle class, at least now. we've almost always went on yearly vacations, my parents each own (nice) used cars, and also purchased me a used car to get to & from school. my mom grew up poor, so her attitude towards money has always been quite frugal: thrift anything possible, grocery shop carefully with coupons to get the best prices, pretty strict budgeting. she made it a point that she never wanted us to experience things that she had. in order to go to college, my parents made too much to qualify for significant financial aid, but not enough to actually afford my education (i had a sibling in college at the same time as me), so i took out what totaled around 25k in federal loans and 60k in private loans.

my parents have been helping me pay interest on my loans and will continue to do so, but the rest falls on me (though they're willing to help out if i can't make payments, so i don't default). i am very thankful for this because otherwise my situation would be a lot worse. that being said, with my college major (visual art) and the current job market, it's not looking great for me. i have a shitty part-time job rn but it is obviously not enough to be able to afford rent and my loan payments, plus other necessities, so i have to move home until i find something full-time that pays at least $20/hr. i feel a lot of dread and fear about this.

my financial situation is confusing for me to be in, because i can't afford to live on my own and i live quite frugally, but i do have support and a safety net. i just entered a relationship where my partner does not, at least not to the same extent as i. i've expressed that i can't afford rent right now so im moving home, that i have significant burdensome debt that will take 10+ years to get rid of, etc, but am worried that my attitude towards money will come off as disingenuous and pretending-to-be-poor once they realize my family is upper-middle class, though definitely not with generational wealth. family stuff is complicated being queer. i love my family, i am thankful for their support, but i don't feel myself at home. they tell me that they want me to be comfortable, but it doesn't feel true. there's always this unspoken pressure in to remain close to the status-quo. it's like their support comes with conditions: and in those conditions i don't feel like i can be myself. i grew up in a big family, am autistic, and for much of my earlier life struggled to make friends. for a while family was the only sort of community i knew.

my parents aren't awful by any means, i love them, i'm just worried living at home will ignite this old version of me that i hate so much and that i will relapse, and/or that my partner will not like my family (or that my family won't like them). it's a new relationship and i've never been in a serious relationship before. i'm 22. living at home makes me feel like i lose autonomy, and im worried my partner will sense this and this will change how they view me. i would appreciate any thoughts/words of wisdom/similar stories, i just feel really lost and dreadful about the future, and about these two worlds of mine colliding. i don't exactly know what i want or where my life is going, but im trying, and i really like this person","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mhwsuz/rant_navigating_moving_home_after_college_and_a/","1754359594.0","Adulting","Final-Reputation8699"
"Finally moved out of parents house, but have homesickness and anxiety of being an adult.","I (24M) had the very fortunate opportunity to buy a house and last week I finally moved into it with my gf. But as soon as I moved all of my stuff in, I couldn‚Äôt help but shake off the fact that I started feeling severely homesick. I miss being able to talk to my parents and my siblings whenever I could and I hate how quiet the house is. I live 15 minutes away from my parents and they told me that I can come over whenever but knowing that I have to come back to my place leaves a pit in my stomach. 

I still come over on Sundays to watch F1 and NASCAR since we‚Äôre huge Motorsport fans, and on my days off I invite my siblings to come over and watch shows with me, but as soon as they leave or I have to come back to my place again I get that pit in my stomach as I said before. It especially hits when I‚Äôm with my brother, since we‚Äôve always had a close relationship and we would talk and hang out in each other‚Äôs room every single day. I feel guilty at times for leaving him and it gets me really emotional. 

On top of that, I feel stressed about becoming an adult: mortgage, bills, and groceries. I‚Äôve already started budgeting and calculating my expenses and fortunately with all bills paid and if we keep our grocery expenses not too high, we can end the month with a bit of extra money. But just having to think of that is mentally draining. And on top of that I still have to think about what to eat! 

I‚Äôve tried to distract myself at home with the hobbies that I enjoy like playing video games or practicing my guitar, but sometimes I‚Äôm too sad to really get up and do it. I‚Äôve had a hard time trying to unbox the rest of my stuff and I‚Äôve cried a couple of times since I‚Äôve moved out. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôve made a big mistake and I wish I could‚Äôve just stayed home, but I know that this is good for me and it‚Äôll set me up for success, but I wish I could just go back to being a kid and not have to worry about any of this. Any ways to help get through this? Will it get any better?

I recently graduated highschool and throughout those 4 years of my life I‚Äôve dedicated myself to an extracurricular program Medical Technician, Lab and Science I‚Äôve been doing it for about 3 years in highschool. I started in the 10th grade it was a rocky start but eventually I got myself together and worked worked so hard. Eventually senior year came and I worked my ass off non stop I stopped everything just to work for this class that dedicated 4 hours of my life over and over again I had three of those classes everyday for 4 hours straight and kept on working harder and harder everyday I put school before work. I just kept studying and studying and studying because apart of that course phlebotomy was an extracurricular course and I had the option to join with the following courses I did through the program so of course I did. I work my ass off non stop I make sure I had all the qualifications to become a phlebotomist and working the medical field is such a huge inspiration and passion I have I want to be a Neonatal Nurse so damn bad so the fact that I was even in the this program my school paid for and I could graduate a phlebotomist at 18 was so damn happy I was so proud of myself my family so proud and my friends. Here comes the day 4 days before graduation and I FUCKING FAILED BY 5 POINTS I FELT SO DISCOURAGED AND DISGUSTED IN MYSELF. I am such a perfectionist I try to do EVERYTHING right so everybody can be proud of me. I‚Äôm not proud of myself I feel like a failure even though I graduated with honors and 4.3gpa. I just feel dumb and useless. My own mother is becoming worried about me. I stoped studying and lost motivation I feel as if I‚Äôm a stupid person and that becoming a nurse is stupid for me think because I feel like a huge failure and disappointment everyone was counting on me. I wanted to show my siblings what a good example is because I am the oldest, but I feel so stupid. People keep telling me they think I‚Äôm so smart and have everything together and will live a good a life but I just feel like it‚Äôs falling apart. Nothing I had planned is working out. I‚Äôm afraid adulthood is going to literally kill me and I just became one 5 months ago. I keep trying because I‚Äôve always been an optimistic person but it‚Äôs just so hard to be proud of myself when all my life people around think I‚Äôm always the one to be successful. I just think discouragement is hard and reminiscing is exhausting. All that hard work I put in just to feel like a dumbass person with no future.

"what do I do with my mom who doesn't want me to go back?","  


I have been studying abroad for three years, I went back home twice in these three years. This summer I didn‚Äôt go back, I took summer courses and continued my job. I send my family money frequently and I have started paying for my brother‚Äôs uni tuition. My family is very poor, I am one of their few sources of income.



I‚Äôd like to spend three weeks at home over winter break in December, but my mom thinks I should stay and keep working so I can save up the plane ticket money and my potential extra expenses there, especially that I will not be working. And I know she is gonna ask me to do this again next year.

  


But this year I had so much pressure on me, I am studying engineering and working, and I have a humble academic background. It‚Äôs been very busy and hard, I barely had time for friends and I am so fkn burnt out and lonely right now, my siblings are growing up so fast without me being there for them. I get that my mom wants to experience life now since she never had a chance to before. but I am afraid that I am also paying a lot for my youth, I am in my 20s working and studying all the time, unhappy and lonely. I want to see my friends and family at least for 2 weeks per year, is that selfish? What is the right thing to do here



Some extra context:¬†



Keep in mind that after my dad was mrdrd at the age of 9, my mom didn‚Äôt leave me and my only brother stayed with us and sacrificed a lot of her youth for us. And she also made sure that we understand that very well. As she would always threaten us if we don‚Äôt behave well to throw us to the streets. Although I love her and know now that she would‚Äôve never done that, I feel like I have this huge debt on my shoulder to pay back that I never asked for.¬†

It's my dream school, and although there are nice universities where I live, I'd still like to attend NYUAD. My school grades are pretty decent- I had like a 93% in 9th grade, 90% in 10th grade, 96% in 11th grade, and I'm going into 12th grade. I have a 1340 on the SAT (didn't study - literally registered for fun, I'm doing the August SAT and actually studying) and a 4 on AP Calculus AB. I have a few extracurriculars - might not be the best, but they are pretty good. The most important thing I wanted to ask about is:

I'm having a huge problem with my Common App essay and my Common App in general. I did fill out the Additional Information Challenges section (I had quite a few personal circumstances - had to take care of my parents since they were both sick, had to help manage finances and budget, helped my sister study, cooked and cleaned most of the time, and other things as well). I wrote it kind of like an essay, but in an emotional way. Formal - but emotional. If anyone would like to see it to give me feedback on it, let me know because I'm not comfortable posting it here. My main point is, I don't know how to write the Common App essay - at all. I don't know how to start, what to write, what to avoid, how to write, etc. I've read a lot of articles and advice, and I keep seeing different things, which confuses me. If anyone has advice on this part, I'd really appreciate it. I just want to know how to start and what to avoid - I can go from there. The second thing is: what are my chances? I know my SAT needs to be improved, and I'm working on that, but my personal circumstances aren't helping. I'm also taking quite a few AP's in my senior year (I think it was 7 AP's), and I'm trying to work on my extracurriculars. If someone could give me tips on how to improve my application and what to work on to improve my chances, I'd also appreciate that. NYUAD is my only hope honestly - it has good financial aid, and the education is great. Before people start telling me they've reduced their financial aid offers and whatnot - I know. But it's my only hope. The other uni's in my country are really expensive and it's extremely difficult to get scholarships in them. Appreciate any advice/help.

"Am I cooked? Please genuine thoughts? I can‚Äôt write for üí©","           The tip of my pinky lies sliced on the ground. I thought I was being careful, but I wasn‚Äôt. I told my mom, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid, I know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù Not three minutes later, I was bleeding, missing part of my finger, and realized I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing.
That‚Äôs one card in my deck.
I collect playing cards, not just for games but because each deck is unique and tells its own story. I stay up late learning complicated shuffles and tricks‚Äînot for show but because I like figuring things out. 
One day, while staring at my computer trying to write this essay, my eyes wandered to my favorite deck: Theory11‚Äôs black Artisans. And it hit me. My life is like a deck of cards. Every card holds a moment: some painful, some happy, some boring, but all part of me.
I‚Äôve picked four stories, or cards, that together tell my story.
The King of Spades, a symbol of authority, responsibility, and tough lessons learned through mistakes, represents a moment that changed me. The summer before eighth grade, I was in the kitchen slicing cucumber on a mandolin, foolishly not using the handguard. My mom walked by, told me to be careful, and asked if I needed help. I said I didn‚Äôt‚ÄîI‚Äôd done it before. Then I felt a sharp pain in my right pinky. I was more embarrassed than worried and tried to play it off despite the blood. That summer was ruined‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt swim or use my right hand. More importantly, I learned a lesson about stubbornness and paying attention. The King of Spades reminds me that growing up means taking responsibility for mistakes.
The Ace of Diamonds symbolizes ambition, discovery, and new beginnings. It fits my love for geography. I spent hours making country flags from construction paper and taping over 100 of them on my bedroom walls. I read tourist guides, studied terrain and languages, and memorized the street map of Florence, Italy. I wasn‚Äôt doing it for school‚ÄîI just liked imagining life in places I‚Äôd never been. That curiosity turned into a passion for learning about the world.

The Jack of Hearts means warmth and unexpected connection, which fits the moment I played soccer on a muddy, makeshift field in Guatemala. It started with seven or eight kids from the family we were building a house for, but as word spread, more kids showed up. There were 20 Guatemalan kids against us four. We didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, and they didn‚Äôt speak English, but that didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîwe played anyway. That game wasn‚Äôt planned, but it stuck with me. It reminds me that connection doesn‚Äôt need translation. The Jack of Hearts, my Wild Card, shows how unplanned things can often be the most meaningful.

The Nine of Clubs is tied to perseverance and growth through struggle. It reminds me of my second flight as a pilot. It was a warm day, and I was still getting used to the shaking in the cockpit. After multiple runs in the pattern practicing takeoffs and landings, I began to feel sweaty and nauseous. On the last turn toward the runway, I felt it coming up. I held it in as we landed, and my instructor made a radio call so I could get out. Most people would quit, but weirdly, it stuck with me. I knew flying was still what I wanted. This story reminds me that even messy starts can lead somewhere steady, and even if they don‚Äôt look the best, it still counts.

"My life is truly fucked would like some advice on what to do?","So this whole relationship started off as her sending a late night text and then we started there things were good we were texting each other late at night until early hours morning and then we decided to meet up and start seeing each other alot more because we have already known each other our life as we both went to the same primary and secondary school but nothing ever happened until now. 

We fell in love in that first phase of a relationship where everything else dosent matter apart from you two spending time with each other and making each other happy and just having that first young love stage anyway as we found out more stuff about each other we loved it until we found out stuff we dont like such as I feel like she treats her ex better than she did me becsuse he was in a much better position than I am such as no addictions, does drive , good family relations , good job and lived in a good house with his parents but was on a 80k a year salary so that started some worries for me and finding out she had a freinds with benefits about 2 weeks before me which I can move past. 

There was obviously things she didnt like about me but nothing serious because she was my first proper relationship i lost my virginity to her but she didnt like how my family was because it is riddled with drug addicts including me but im inly addicted to weed whereas my family has problems such as smack, crack and other shit and have had alot of family problems and trauama that has turned me into who I am and she says im not as nice as her ex but its because he lived the free life where everything got given to him with all the help and support he needs with no drama.

Anyway time moves on I got a part time job to support her and mine lifestyle for now until we get into a good place because I was going college but never turned up because of her but things were still happy even though we didnt have alot of money we still made it what it was and had fun with the little money but my problems were as stated and she said she feels uncomfortable sexualisng herself to me because she thinks I see her as a slag due to his freinds with benefits situation which isn't true but she feels that way and made me feel like well she can giver herself up whenever her ex wanted what's different with me so thats been a problem questioning if she is attracted or loves me.

Anyway I eventually get forced into a full time job by my dad which caused alot of stress as I didnt want to do the job and tool up alot of my time which I wanted to spend with my girlfreind but I couldn't becusse I needed to pay for this holiday my dad booked me on so I took the job which caused me to stress at my girlfreind a little bit because I felt like she wasn't doing enough even though I was trying to everything to make her happy and caused problems for a little bit. 

BOOM we find out shes pregnant which was a foundation for the future stress to come as I was a complete knob and stressed at her worrying about my own happiness because I felt like I had to tend to her and the kid and my own happiness/needs were not being met because I dont want this kid because nothing is in the right place for this kid to be born but she dosent see that and I understand that but I dont want to live a life of unhappiness trying my hardest to make 2 people happy that won't do it for me so im struggling alot lately bevause its more like a friendship as she said she feels uncomfortable sexualising herself to me so we some have sex anymore or even intimate moments but she uses me to grind on but when it comes to me its different so I dont get how she feels uncomfortable sexualiang herself to me then there's the real stuff we don't have a house i cant drive yet I only have a part time job I smoke weed her mum dosent like me so what i am to do.
 
I just dont know what to do anymore its not like im not going to step up because I am i just dont know if i will be happy and this is the life I want to lead I want a happy life where everything is in healthy amounts and I dont want to be 40 years of age regretting my life choices this ia probably a good time to mention we are both 20 and she has asperges and adhd and is considered a vulnerable adult so I dont know what to do because I dont see a way I can make this happy I can make this happy for everyone else but I dont think my happiness can fit in that plan. 

There is alot more to this story so I will need to remember and I would love questions as that would help me better concise this story and the help I need but thankyou for listening or reading shall I say

"Struggling as an adult financially all the time..","Hi everyone.. 
I feel lost and I'm just surviving and not actually living anymore.

I am in a large amount of debt (large for me anyhow). 25k debt from fertility treatments, and  I still have no baby from it. 

We (spouse and i) have decided to put that dream of a family on hold temporarily because I would hate to bring an innocent angel into our lives with our current financial struggles. 

We also have a small farm with goats, cattle, cats, dogs, etc.. so most of my check goes towards the feed and bills for the animals. All of that was completely manageable until we started the journey to have a baby and found out it was going to be more difficult for us than the traditional way. Now I feel like we are drowning and barely able to make ends meet with my large debt amount. 

I hate going to the store for groceries because I know it will be a ridiculous total for only a few items for the two of us.
I hate going out anywhere that we have to spend extra money just to do activities and/or date nights.

We have always ended up surviving, but the struggle seems to be getting harder these days. 
My vehicle will be paid off summer of 2026, so that will atleast help a little. 

Even with all the things I hate to spend money on, I still feel an inner fight within myself that says ""you only live once, just spend the extra $20 and you'll figure the rest out later"".

"AI is going to automate basically everything within a few years time","It's terrifying, and I don't understand how people are okay with this. Genuinely speaking; future generations will be dumber than ours, depend on machines for everything, have no jobs opportunities, and the list goes on.

Eventually, we won't be able to tell the difference between reality and simulation, and the majority of the populous won't know how to live without a machine telling them exactly what to do and when. Personal thoughts? Think again, they won't exist. Free thinkers will cease to exist, and the world will turn into a ""utopia"" prison. Ads will be on every corner of everything, and we won't be able to turn them off - not even in our own heads once everybody is chipped with technological ""enhancements"".

I WAS thinking of giving the SAT however didnt want to waste hours of my time on something that might not even be required.

"Am I cooked if I apply ED (need almost full fin aid)?","Pls help me. I am going to be a senior this year, and I have one school that I am extremely passionate about. I have been debating EDing there for awhile. 

However, I am very worried about the finances of doing so. To provide a little bit of information, I have divorced parents, and my mom is remarried. I have two full siblings and two half siblings that are my moms and stepdads, of which I am the oldest. Mom + Stepdad make around 100,000 combined. Dad makes a lot less, however from what I have seen most colleges would only, or at least mostly, look at my mom + stepdad. Nothing crazy as far as assets, both parents own reasonable homes. Savings are kind of depleted from the divorce on both sides so ig that may help me. 

I have done net price calculators for this school and the results look decently promising. Last time I believe my net price was going to be around 6,000-8,000, which with National Merit (hopefully) plus my own and parents money should be doable without loans. 

I am worried that my package may not look this good, as I have heard the if you apply ED this is sometimes the case and it can be harder to negotiate for aid.

**MY MAIN QUESTION**

If I apply ED, get in, but the aid package is not as good as I mentioned above, what are my next steps? Specifically, could I submit apps for other colleges after I get in ED in case I cannot get my price down, but if I get the price I need withdraw those applications? It just seems that if I apply ED then my aid is not good enough, I'm kinda screwed if I cannot submit other apps while trying to negotiate aid and would probably have to go to my state school. 

BTW my guidance counselor said she would fine with me applying ED. 

If you have made is this far, thank you! If you have anything that would help I would very much appreciate it. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1midamc/am_i_cooked_if_i_apply_ed_need_almost_full_fin_aid/","1754410023.0","ApplyingToCollege","Ok_Attention_7080"
"I am deeply overwhelmed by it all - how I've been feeling for awhile","I (Enbie, 22) have been attending college for a bit, my education has been non-linear due to mental health and physical health issues. Upon returning for this full-time semester, my tuition has almost tripled. None of the advisors at my school, nor my personal financial advisor, can give me a good answer or solution. My dad is paying for half of my bill, but his ""you have a job, you can pay for it"" mentality is making my already chronic anxiety worse. I am overwhelmed by thoughts of failure, how I am perceived, how my friends think of me, and why almost all of them are ghosting me. I have tried calling off and on, leaving messages, texting them, nothing seems to work. I only have two consistent friends who I do things with, but even they are inconsistent. I now remember so much of my childhood, lots of lonely memories. I've always been an only child, people who I though I was friends with were actually my bullies and those who were actually my friends are no longer in contact with me. I remember I cried a lot, even in high school I remember sitting in the stairwell sobbing to myself. Even with my refuge of art growing over the years, I never felt that any of my friendships were true as all of them felt as if they were out of pity. As the looming increase of medication and medical care costs grow ever closer, I wonder why I keep trying. I want to go back, I want to start over, I just want to fix that little kid who never felt like they were loved.

"hardship appeal","Hi everyone, I‚Äôm appealing to keep my institutional grant after a tough year that dropped my GPA slightly below the required 2.5. I'd really appreciate honest, constructive feedback on my letter ‚Äî especially around tone, length, or anything that might improve my chances.

Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_ Financial Aid Appeals Committee,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and I am writing to you today in this hardship appeal letter regarding my current GPA of 2.43, which falls slightly below the 2.5 requirement. My purpose in writing this letter today is to ask for a review with consideration of my financial aid eligibility due to personal hardships I experienced that impacted my academic performance during the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters.¬†

I am aware that to be considered for \_\_\_ Hardship appeal, the circumstances must be beyond a student‚Äôs given control. The struggles in which I faced Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters, including a severe health scare requiring oncology evaluation, chronic anemia symptoms, and seeing my grandfather battle cancer earlier on that year deeply affected me later on emotionally, especially when it came to my own health.

My fall semester began with a cancer scare. My persistent 3-year anemia diagnosis affected my health, but I never realized the severity until my general doctor‚Äôs checkups turned into oncologist appointments. Having witnessed my grandfather die from cancer before my very eyes for months before his eventual death in 2024, and the emotional toll of knowing it too could be me facing the same life-threatening illness, deeply overwhelmed me. The stress of not knowing the results of my blood for months until finally knowing I was clear in late November hindered my ability to focus and perform well in class, which ultimately affected my academic standing through months marked by chronic stress and symptoms of fatigue and brain fog. I‚Äôve attached medical appointments reflecting the visits and appointments.

Aside from these physical health issues are years of mental health struggles that I never formally addressed. As a first-generation college student and eldest daughter, all my life I struggled with being vulnerable. Vulnerability in the household I come from is a synonym for weakness, and is an excuse rather than a truth. These internal pressures of anxieties, self-worth issues, and disordered eating habits affected my home life, and now they affect my academic future. They led to fainting episodes and worsened anemic symptoms from starving myself and not eating enough. I chose to carry myself in silence rather than to seek medical and academic support because I feared burdening others. I now recognize the deep harm in that, and I take full accountability for not seeking help, and I‚Äôm committed to doing better for myself.¬†

I academically struggled most in Math \_\_, and failed it in the Fall 2024 semester. I am not proud of that standing, but that experience of failure taught me the importance of open communication with professors, peers, tutors, and support systems, as well as listening to my body and prioritizing my health. Passing out in public before my differential calculus test needed an adequate response of going to the doctor and communicating with my professor, rather than my decision of carrying on as if nothing had occurred.

These circumstances are not unique, and although they were difficult to endure, I hold full responsibility for the result of my academic standing with my 2.43 cumulative GPA. After learning from my experiences, I am determined and know that I can and will raise academic results. I‚Äôve since worked with my advisor to switch to a major better suited for my strengths and interests of International Business, and I am also retaking my Math \_\_\_. Going forward, this is the specific steps I plan to take to ensure academic and personal success:

Academically, I will be attending all classes with active participation, retaking my Math \_\_ and attending calculus tutor sessions at the Student Success Center, utilizing the office hours of my professors to openly communicate and have a better grasp of my courses, and working in study groups amongst my course and major peers. In health, I will hold myself accountable by using the Student Counseling Center for therapy, seek a formal mental health diagnosis, commiting to balanced healthy meals, and being involved in group wellness activities such as the university's cycling club. In accountability, I will practice being vulnerable with professors, peers, and health providers when facing challenges rather than isolating myself.

Due to the nature of my family dynamics, I do not currently have access to a formal obituary for my grandfather, but a livestreamed video of the funeral exists and can be shared privately if requested. I am submitting medical documentation where available and hope that my personal statement provides the necessary context.

I sincerely am thankful for your time today in reading my letter and considering my appeal. I am very determined this semester and going forward until I complete my degree to succeed academically at \_\_\_, and I remain grateful for the support that this institution provides to all, including me. Should you need any additional documentation, I would be grateful for the opportunity to provide it.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,

"I think I have made a mistake choosing ASU online","So, I chose to do ASU online because they have a food industry management degree and thought it would be perfect for what I want do to. The tuition is  37,000 which turns into 20,000 after financial aid that have to be paid back. Me being stupid though that the tuition was for the entire 4 years.... I was wrong. It's just for one year. My total tuition will be over 80,000. Now I feel lied too. I was like $20,000? That's not bad 

My theory is they only show what's for the entire year but not make entirely clear because if they told you the total on the entire 4 years no one would attend that school. Which is where am at right now.

I saw that SNHU actually shows what the full four year tuition would cost which 41,000+. They have some degrees am interested in.

I start school on the 21st, would it be a bad idea to  withdraw and try to attend at SNHU online? I have started so I don't think they'll charge me.

However due to many reasons and thinking it over, I do not want to stay in state. Mainly political reasons as Ohio has passed some laws that make my personal life, especially if I went to a public college, a lot harder.

But I have tremendous guilt 
That j could have done more 
My mom is super bipolar and aggressive and sometimes she's my best friend and someone's she's super evil and trying to get me in trouble for shit I never did. 
My grandma didn't always protect me but she tried
Now whenever I visit her I get angry and idk how to control the anger 
I have trouble just going to visit her 
I want to be there but it's hard I feel pain and rage and I don't know why 
They abandoned me and mis treated me and didn't protect me 
My mom threw me in debt 
Grandma promised to help and didn't 
They left me with 25 cats and nothing but the bills for the house that I paid with no refund 
Now I'm in over $11k since October 
I'm down to 7500$ paying it down and it's not fair 
I feel alone 
I want to be with grandma and get past this anger but whenever I'm there she just talks about me getting married and being a woman and I hate it .i 

That's not what I'm even thinking about 
I don't give a fuck about kids and marriage I have my boyfriend since 2020 and I don't want kids nor can we have kids anyway bc I think my bf is shooting blanks but good I don't want kids anyway 
Whatever 
How do I get past this anger? I want to be happy before she died and be on Good terms 
I tried therapy for years and I still go and I hate my current counselor 
But I just don't feel happy 
Even when I had a great counselor I don't feel like anything improved 
What do I do? How do I feel better 

.tldr grandma dying 
I'm angry she didn't protect me as a kid and even now Mt mom put me in debt bc grandma was in. Coma and grandpa died and Mt mom ran away across to Alaska and left me with 25 cats and a house to pay for ... 
I want to be happy and love grandma and be with her again 
I want to grieve for Mt grandpa

"Will Credits Transfer?","Hey all!

I am currently trying to go back to school. I plan on going online for Electrical Engineering to ASU or UofA. However, after reading some I noticed how expensive they are. I live in TN and found out I am eligible for TN Reconnect which I believe will pay my way to an Associates Degree. I plan on attending a community college called Motlow, because it appears they have an online program for electrical engineering as well. From what I understand ASU is ABET accredited but Motlow is not, it is SACSCOC. I may be overthinking it, but, if I get my associates there, will I be able to transfer to an ABET accredited school?

"Please help w/ letters of recs üôè","So I‚Äôm sending 3 LORs (+ counselor) and I‚Äôm really torn on who to choose for the last one. 

Im applying to a lot of reaches (EDing Brown PLME) so my LORs are super super important. My stats are good (3.978/4.6 + 36 ACT) and my ECs are below for reference. Majoring in biochem on a premed track, and as you can see below I have a pretty large spike in science/med. 


- I have my first two recs locked and ik they‚Äôll be really really good:

1. AP bio teacher + club supervisor
2. Research mentor

- My counselor one will probably be just okay

For my last two options I have:
1. Anatomy teacher
2. French teacher 

**both have already said yes btw**

I participated a lot in the anatomy class and I think the teacher likes me a lot. For French I participated a bit, but mostly was just a good example for other students (it was a really really bad class lmao). I‚Äôm so torn on who to pick. 

I heard you‚Äôre supposed to have a humanities teacher, and I was gonna pick my band teacher bc he knows me super well but apparently it won‚Äôt count as a teacher rec. 

**If I had to guess, the anatomy teacher would write the better req, but I‚Äôm worried that having such a science focused app will make me look one dimensional. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt have as strong of a relationship w/ my French teacher, and idk if she‚Äôd be able to write a strong one.**

**I will talk to my counselor, but he has never been really helpful for me. If anyone has any insight on which to pick, I‚Äôd really really appreciate it. Sorry for the rant**

"Feeling sad about lack of friends and support","I‚Äôm a hyper independent person as a result of the interesting life I had growing up. I‚Äôm also highly sensitive with the people I care about.

Somehow I feel I always was catching up on friendships, through life changes and relocations. I have several friends but they are all scattered around the globe and after time, sometimes forgotten behind.

I try to keep track of my friendships and invest time and effort to them, but I notice more and more how I am the only one reaching out. More often I am the only one than not and is starting to get me. Most of my friends don‚Äôt live in this town anymore and the ones around seem to drift away. 

Today is especially sad for me because several things are pilling up and I have no one to share them with.  Even my own family is distant. I get this hyper independence makes it seem to everyone that I have everything together but the truth is I don‚Äôt. I have shared this with my family without much change in their behavior.

I am touched starved and don‚Äôt even know how to start on this ‚Äúfinding friends in adulthood‚Äùjourney. It seems so daunting and I have cried a lot today about all of this. It feels pathetic to be in this situation, I cannot help but to think that something is wrong with me.

"Second guessing my classes","So, I‚Äôm going back to school after 30ish years. Most of my previous credits, while transferable, are irrelevant to my new degree plan. I believe the only two that would get me out of required course are English Comp and Calculus. English Comp I am thrilled to not have to do again. But the math credit‚Ä¶I DON‚ÄôT even remember \*taking\* Calculus in college, much less any of the content. Also, I‚Äôm in now for Business Management so if I did remember anything I doubt it would be any help. So I registered for a Contemporary Mathematics class this fall. 

Yesterday, I got an email from a counselor saying that my math credit was sufficient for the requirement, so they‚Äôd removed CM from my schedule and instructed me to pick something else. Instead I went and put myself back into the class I‚Äôd originally registered for. I let them know I appreciated the credit but I wanted the refresher anyway. But now I‚Äôm wondering if I will have any regrets about taking a class I don‚Äôt have to, for either time or money purposes, or both.

"If I transfer in college, will I lose all hope at a solid relationship?","Don't know if this type of post is allowed here or not, but here it goes. I am considering doing a 2+2 option in college where I start two years at one school, and then transfer for the second two years to a different school. However, one of my main concerns with following this path is this: what if I meet someone at school 1? What if I start dating someone I really like/love, and then I need to leave them? What if I feel like I can't? Granted, I'm only transferring to a school where I'll be living about 3 hours away from the first school, but still. I won't see them everyday or probably even every week, that's for sure. What if I subconsciously ""box myself out"" of dating at the first school, since I'll be leaving? Or what if nobody wants to enter a relationship with someone transferring out halfway through college? And what if I can't make friends / get involved socially at the second school, since most everyone there will have established friend groups and know each other from the first two years? Do you think that will make dating really challenging at the second school, too?

I am going to grad school after undergrad, so part of me thinks ""I'd be leaving after four years of undergrad anyway,"" but at that point it's possible for my would-be-doesn't-exist-yet-girlfriend to try and focus on jobs where I'd be going to grad school, or for me to apply to targeted grad schools in areas where said girlfriend would be working or also going to grad school. College is also¬†*at least*¬†a guaranteed four years in the relationship before school ends generally, but it'd be cut in half if I did this transfer program. On top of dating, I worry about leaving regular friends at the first school, as well, or whether I'd be able to make friends at the school I transfer to. Please let me know if all of my concerns are valid, or if I am overreacting about this. I am so worried I am going to ruin my life while in college or ruin my chances of having a good relationship, especially since a lot of people meet their partners in college.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1miq1ia/if_i_transfer_in_college_will_i_lose_all_hope_at/","1754439538.0","ApplyingToCollege","ThePrimePC"

I am not at all familiar with US college admission therefore, any help after reading questions and situations below will be much appreciated.

Kid at 7th grade

Not into any sports

Plays violin but not into something prestigious like SF orchestra/Oakland orchestra 

Got A+ in all the 6th grade classes.

Don‚Äôt matter much as middle school grades don‚Äôt count.

Loves(?) to do math.

Got placed into Algebra 1 for 7th grade

We came to know about AMC8 and kid got 11/25 - 6th grade

Since then trying AOPS books for a re-try

Don‚Äôt have much coding/computer skills.

Loves to build mechanical things like Lego Technik, ROKR, electric circuits etc

Now Questions:

In this forum as well as graduates from my area I see applications such as:

- Build Apps with 200k+ DAU
- Math/Physics Olympiad Champions 
- Did Research in Stanford as Sophomore 
- Deca ( whatevs ) leader
- Varsity Swimming etc

Even in my office I have coworkers whose 7th graders are trying for MLS/NBA etc ( mostly in private schools) or Robotics 

**So my question is**

What should we do ?

How would we come to know of this kind of opportunities?

Even if we somehow come to know how to get my kid into say ‚Äòinternship at Stanford‚Äô ?

I have no friend to tell me this + Bay area tier-2 schools where nobody will tell me anything.

"Life getting harder as I get older","I feel behind.

All my peers are making significantly more money than me (2x +) with similar backgrounds.

The stress of not making enough and not reaching my full potential compensation wise is eating me alive. I chose a higher risk higher reward path but wasn‚Äôt successful in achieving the high reward, I definitely learned a lot, but it hasn't translated to $$s . How to manage this emotionally and continue moving forward ? I have been thinking a lot about this lately and getting negative thoughts.

I feel dumb to make the career choices I made given how left behind I now am. Maybe I should start doing what they do, and switch to a field I don‚Äôt particularly like but will make me tons more money. This might be still realistic as I am young (26 year old). I know I shouldn‚Äôt be comparing with others, but I find it a useful benchmark to know what I could become if I wanted to, with some hard work of-course.

I'm currently making 250K, managed to save aggressively and have a net worth of 1.5m.

"I want to pay off debt and save for the future","Over the past couple yrs, I‚Äôve managed to accumulate debt of c.¬£15.5k through 5 credit cards and 1 loan.

Now I have various deadlines to pay off my debt.  
3k by Nov ‚Äò25
2k by Dec ‚Äò25
6k by June ‚Äò26
4.5k by Jan ‚Äò27


Background: 
I grew up with 2 parents who were too ill to work, I became a young carer when I was 8. I haven‚Äôt taken any money from my parents after I turned 16. I did well with my GCSE‚Äôs, had to do my a-levels in 3 yrs and didn‚Äôt go to uni. 

I worked from as early as I could. I started in customer services and retail which lead me to having 2 jobs and working 7 days a week for a couple yrs, I managed to save 12k by 2020 which I was very proud of. I became the ‚Äúbank‚Äù of the family even though I am the youngest. I‚Äôd always be lending money to my siblings and even some friends. 

I started a job in corporate debt collection in 2020, my first proper 9-5 office job which I kept for 3yrs. (Very grateful as this company ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù my career path in finance). 
With no qualifications, I was able to get jobs doing accounts receivable work and that has since turned into my career route. 

Our lives changed in 2020 when my dad was diagnosed with cancer and passed away 3 weeks after his diagnosis (he spent the last week of his life in a coma) so we really had no time to arrange or process anything. 

I covered the funeral costs with my savings. My Dad was not in a position to leave us with money. With bills to pay and my mom unable to work + past retirement age. I became the main rent and bill payer at home. (Sister had MH breakdown and didn‚Äôt work and brother has always earned significantly less than me). 
We only have one car in the family, in early 2021 that was involved in an accident and written off, we used the remainder of my savings to get another car (essential for the family) 

Back to current:
Over the past couple of years, I‚Äôve accumulated  a lot of debt. I paid some of it off and now I am left with ¬£15.5k 
My sister moved out and my brother and I now manage the rent and bills between us. 

My monthly outgoing is ~¬£950pm for bills and rent. (Take home pay is ¬£2k pm with ~¬£400pm for food, travel, and living a life) 

I recently (May‚Äô25) got engaged to my partner of 4 yrs. We‚Äôre planning to marry in late 2027 or early 2028. 

I now work at a start-up and earn more than some ppl with lvl3 qualifications. I handle all accounts payable and receivable duties for this company. There is only me and the CFO in the finance team. My company has v.graciously offered to pay for the 1yr of a finance related qualification (I chose CIMA Cert in Business Accounting, as I plan to complete the CIMA but need the certificate due to no degree). I got my ADHD diagnosis last week so hopefully I‚Äôll be able to access study support to have the best chance of passing after being out of study for over a decade. The full qualification will cost me -9k over 3yrs once I complete the certificate. It looks a worthwhile investment to me as my earring potential will more than double what it is now. 

Since my engagement it has dawned on me that I need to prioritize paying my debt off and saving for a future with my fianc√© (ie wedding, house, and my qualifications)

I‚Äôve cut my expenses down and I‚Äôve been using the remaining money to pay debt off. 

Currently all of my debt split is payable but 
I also need to rebuild my savings (emergency funds, study, wedding) as well as paying off my debt. 

My goal is to become debt-free, save for my future and become financially stable. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any advise available do how to best go about this (and maybe how to earn extra money alongside my 9-5 and studying).

Thanks you for taking the time to read.

"Scared for what's next","Hey guys I'm a 21 year old Australian and my life has been pretty crazy for the past few years and I could use some advice or assurance. Thank you. 

So I'm the oldest of 4 and I was repedily kicked out by my mum who is a narcissist and on top of that I was exposed to a very toxic domestic violent situation with her and my ex step father. Two years ago I had a seizure because of them and afterwards became very depressed. 

In my eyes I was the complete scum of the earth. I was working at McDonald's, was sleeping in a caravan, didn't go out and I can't drive. I have massive anxiety about driving due to my mum consistently grabbing the wheel while I was and putting my baby brother in the backseat so I tried to amend this by beginning murdered by a licence since I can drive out on my Ls but then I had a seizure so I couldn't drive for 6 months. That meant I couldn't get my ps and I had to redo my test so just kind of let it drop. 

So now to the better stuff ig. 

I was kicked out officially in February this year so I went to my aunt's who helped me set up the dol and get in contact with youth housing. I left my fast food job but have been searching for another one since which has been a challenge. I've been to interviews but no luck. Still don't drive but I'm saving up for a motorbike so I can go and redo my test and start riding straight away Which unfortunately will have to be another 6 months since I did a scan for my seizure but I'm determined. I've fixed my eating habits and them now working out consistently so may see results soon, overall it's made me feel better.

Now I was contacted yesterday after like seven months of waiting saying that they've found an open spot in a youth house. I'm excited but also terrified. This will be the first time I've been officially on my own and being responsible for my own things and it'll be with strangers in the same situation as me. I'm already used to paying for my own stuff and about 200$ in rent and it'll be cheaper in the youth house but My anxiety is still making me think I'm going to mess up and be homeless again. Also the house may be in the same area where my mum lives so there's that.

"I failed as an adult","I'm starting to become extremely depressed and miserable. I feel like I'm cursed. I feel like there's a evil spirit or ghost over my life that's keeping me poor and in bad positions. At 19 I applied for various restaurant jobs but they refused to hire me. At some point I got a yes from the company only for them to never reply back to me and reject me. At 24 I decided to try and get a role in venture capital. Spent six months trying to get a role as a venture scout. When I finally did every company I submitted was instantly rejected. After 4 months of no success I changed my career to childcare and applied for daycares. I've been rejected from every daycare in my location. I've tried getting a job on my school campus, I applied for 10 roles and everyone rejected me. I've tried day trading but I lost hundreds of dollars and was scammed out of 75 dollars by a prop firm. 

I've been unemployed for eight years. I'm on SSI and live with my parents. I've done everything I possibly could to make money to try and be a normal person. Everything I've done has failed. Everything I've worked hard on has failed. I call myself the queen of rejection and failure because my life is a joke. I fail at everything I try to do.

At this point in my life everything I've done has failed. I was finally able to make friends and be social but this was after over a decade of not having friends and literally being abused by people. 

I don't feel like I'm part of this world or if I deserve to be. I'm starting to wonder if I even deserve to exist. To even be alive like normal people. I don't want to try anymore.

I have no one else to talk to so appreciate any response.



Have recently started taking a new medication, I think it is causing me to go through a mixed episode [I have bipolar disorder]. Basically I just decided today that we should move. Went and viewed an apartment, filled in the application and paid $500 for it. Was so excited to move, it would make everything easier. Now I am having horrible horrible anxiety, I think I made the wrong decision. Not sure if I am ready to move.



Why I am moving: I currently live in Las Vegas, Nevada; I go to school in Berkeley, California [9 hour car ride away]. My classes are in person and for the past three years I have been commuting by plane to and from school two, three, four days a week [depending on the semester]. The rest of the days I work. Obviously this has taken a huge toll on my mental health. We we‚Äôre going to move this August, but decided due to finances to postpone that until December. I called and talked to my father a few days ago and he said I was making a mistake, that I should move now. I would be commuting three days a week while taking upper division classes. I talked it over with my partner and we decided to move, I went and filled the application and borrowed money from family to pay the security deposit. Now that the application is submitted I am feeling immense regret. What if we don‚Äôt like the apartment? We are happy in our current place and the move is my fault, my partner will be affected because of me. What if I fail out of school and then we moved for nothing? What if we can‚Äôt afford it? This apartment is $800 more than our current place. I loved my coworkers, what if my new coworkers suck? Etc etc etc



Please tell me I made the right choice. I feel like I made the biggest mistake of my life. However, I don‚Äôt know if I could have dealt with commuting for another semester.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mitbm4/moving_for_college_did_i_make_the_right_decision/","1754448738.0","college","jensonaj"

"Help me lay out my options? Flat tire","Hi. I have ADHD and while I could definitely do this alone maybe you'll be able to help me be more efficient. Planning is not my strong suit. 

Saturday my car got a flat while I was at my friends place. I had no money to do anything to it, not even to get fix a flat. So I rode with my brother back home. 

I get paid tomorrow. How best should I get my car home. Couple notes/caveats. 

- I have no spare (well I do, but it's on my car already. I plan on getting a full set when I replace them. 

- I have no jack

- I have no car insurance (ik I should but c'est la vie) 

- my tire is completely flat, meaning I can't safely ride it anywhere without risking rim damage.

My friends place, and thus car, is 35 miles away, and there is no public transit there (lol America). 

My tentative plan is: find a way out there, probably uber as it's a weekday and everyone works. Get fix a flat. Use it on my tire. Drive to a nearby tire shop, get a tire installed. Drive home by 7 pm to get to work. 

Any better ideas? More so cheaper, not as worried about time as I have from about 10 am to 6 pm to figure it out.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mitv7i/help_me_lay_out_my_options_flat_tire/","1754450359.0","Adulting","sycamotree"
"Rant","Hey guys probably get hate but, let's get real for a second. We've all been through our fair share of struggles, and it's easy to get caught up in negativity and complaining. But life's too short to waste on dwelling on what's not going well. I've been there too - life and all that comes with it. But I made a conscious decision to focus on the positives and take action towards creating a better life for myself.

Let's appreciate what we have - family, friends, technology, and the little things that make life worth living. Instead of focusing on what we don't have, let's take a step back and appreciate what we do have. Practicing gratitude can shift our mindset and help us see the world in a more positive light.

It's time to stop taking life so seriously and start living it. Take a break from your phone ,cut down on alcohol if you over indulging, stop watching excessive news, and do normal things offline that bring you joy. Go for a walk, spend time with your parents, be with family and be a contributing member of society. Be brave, and stop worrying about what others think. These small moments can bring so much joy and perspective.

Surround yourself with people who uplift you, and don't let negativity bring you down. Take control of your life, and stop self-sabotaging. Become aware of the thoughts and feelings driving this sabotage, and take back control.

Our parents won't be here forever, and it's crucial that we start taking responsibility for our own lives. It's time to get serious about our futures and start working towards our goals. Whether it's getting a job, starting a business, or pursuing higher education, we need to take action. Working hard and being responsible doesn't mean you'll be boring or stuck in a 9-5 grind. It means you'll be in control of your life, making conscious decisions, and creating the life you want it will all work out and be ok just keep trying.

I know it's not always easy, but it's worth it. Don't let fear, anxiety or doubt hold us back from pursuing our dreams. Let's take action, work hard, and create the life we want. With hard work and determination, we can build a bright future for ourselves, family's and friends.

P.S. If you do suffer from mental health issues, please seek help. I promise it can get better with professional support. You are not alone, and there is hope and I'm sure a lot more care then you realise.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1miu1sw/rant/","1754450915.0","GenZ","Littleclover20"
"Is voluntary homelessness a good idea?","18M, honestly this might come off as lazy but I have no desire to get a job or career. I don‚Äôt want a family, don‚Äôt care about material items like cars or clothes. I have always been a minimalist, very introverted and never desired talking to people. My parents and some of my friends question if I‚Äôm depressed or something, but I‚Äôm not. My hobbies, (reading, being outside, lifting) keep me happy and focused. My goal in life is to become as smart and strong as possible. My parents have been begging me to get a job lately and they basically forced me to go to CC and later transfer to a 4 year. All this has made me consider calling it quits after my two free years of CC and choosing a vagabond lifestyle. My city is very safe and clean, there is a library nearby where I can read. I just feel like I have different aspirations than everyone else and I don‚Äôt want a boring life where I work until retirement. Please give any advice if you have lived on the streets or know anybody who has. I come from a middle class background so I know it sounds privileged to want to choose homelessness, but it honestly sounds better than being burdened for the rest of my life with shit I don‚Äôt care about nor will make me progress as a person.

"Is it me, or are teenagers being used as mercenaries in the political war declared by people who hate us regardless of our political affiliation?","Ok, we already know the answer to the above question, but something quite shocking happened in Washington DC today.

First, it was David Hogg and Kyle Kashuv a la the Parkland school shooting. Then, it was Greta Thunberg and her speech at the UN. Oh, and don't forget what happened to Nick Sandmann, or what went down in Kenosha with Kyle Rittenhouse.

Today it's Edward Coristine, aka Big Balls, who was [viciously assaulted](https://thehill.com/homenews/5437989-doge-staffer-big-balls-attacked-dc/) in Washington DC today while trying to save a woman from being attacked by a group of thugs. And the media has its usual circus, where all the keyboard warriors and the Fox News audience congratulates Big Balls for ""being a real man"" only to go back to their fast food, cable news brain rot, and UFC fight nights. 

Hell, I could throw in twenty-somethings like the 13 who died in the botched Afghanistan withdrawal under Biden. They never had a real chance. Many came from poor or working-class backgrounds. They were given the usual go-around: ""Rest in peace, soldier,"" or ""Til Valhalla, corpsman..."" they had names! And now their families are devastated!

So is this it? Are we just gladiator slaves to a machine that seeks to consume us? Regardless of your political stance, we should all be livid that we live in a system that openly congratulates us with a pat on the back for having to Hunger Games our way to mere survival. It shouldn't come down to this in the first place. It shouldn't depend on us in the first place. We don't get to be young and dumb, we have no chance to make our own mistakes or carve our own path, and no room for error.

"regret not taking class seriously sophomore year","during my first year of hs, I was a pretty average student, I took a couple honors and 1 ap but overall I was getting mainly As and Bs with one C being my worst grade. Sophomore year took a whole different turn. I started taking Ap chem along with a couple other hard classes, during this time I found It hard to stay motivated and truly hit peak procrastination especially being in classes with not many friends or support. I got my first Fs and first semester report card had only 1 class that was higher than a C, which was pe. next semester sophomore year I started doing better and passing more classes, but still ended up with a D in one of them. it was during this time in sophomore year where it wasn't striving to get an ""A"" but now its ""as long as I pass."" 

junior year came and definitely improved from the prior year but still was having trouble avoiding Cs. In all I ended the year with around a 2.7 uw and 3.26 w gpa. 

when I was younger I wanted to be a doctor and hoped to be the first in the family to achieve this, during my first two years in hs, I started to become unsure of where I wanted to go or what I wanted to be so my extracurriculars weren't so existent. it was only summer before junior year where I started exploring medicine and decided that I wanted to do premed in undergrad. I still very much hope to do premed, but I feel like such an imposter compared to other prospective premed students. I feel so uncomfortable telling people about my goals to do premed knowing that I have a below avg gpa. my gpa is so low idek if im even a good fit for some of my state schools. Ik that doing cc is an option but after looking into it I don't think its for me, I would love to be apart of a university campus but past shortcomings may be holding me back. in fact I looked over common app and uc piq prompts and I would actually love to write them myself , I have a ton of things to write about and would love to share my story. but I feel like it'd be waste considering my grades like I feel like admissions officers wouldn't even consider a grade like that even with a good essay and SAT score.

either way I still try to hold my chin up, and hope that all this worry will pass.

"A coming HS senior needing advice","Apologizing in advance for the long post. I haven‚Äôt even started to write yet and I know this will be the longest post I‚Äôve ever wrote online, but I need help. Bad. And my family is not supportive enough to provide that. I would be the first in my family to go to college. I don‚Äôt really have friends who I‚Äôm not the ‚Äúmom friend‚Äù to, so essentially, I‚Äôm hoping strangers can help. 

I don‚Äôt have the grades or money for a big college. I do want to experience university life, but I worry i can‚Äôt afford it. Especially since I‚Äôd love to go out of state. Economically this is a really bad time to seek higher education and I don‚Äôt want to take out student loans because I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd pay them back when $30k turns into $300k. Im considering a degree like marketing, communications, business, Agribusiness, ag communications, or really anything that is versatile and creative. I‚Äôd love to be a vet but it‚Äôs much too expensive. I have family out of state, but I don‚Äôt think using their address would lower tuition without breaking some laws along the way. My grades are average, maybe slightly below sometimes when it comes to math. I‚Äôm a phenomenal reader and award winning writer. I‚Äôm extremely involved with FFA, chosen for Principals Select Council, I‚Äôm Student Council president, and recognized by the state for leadership excellence and active volunteering. 

I‚Äôve been average or above until junior year where I was less than average. I had to have emergency surgery in May and never came back. I missed my SAT, AP lang test, and now have to recover half a credit of history despite mastering the STAAR because my teacher decided getting sliced open and laid up in the hospital for three weeks wasn‚Äôt a good enough excuse to turn in a project late.

PSAT I was average for the state of Texas (math 410, english at 510, 920 total). My GPA should be around 3.3. I plan to take AP lit, ACT, and SAT this year, since my window to take AP lang is probably closed. My mom is a stay at home mom but sometimes works as a substitute. I believe they put 2k on the tax report. My dad makes around 80k and does side work but they won‚Äôt tell me the tax info because they don‚Äôt trust the government. I think they will probably be okay with filling out FAFSA, though. Could I even get into college without going bankrupt? 

Now, my plans. Well, ideas I guess.

First, and what I‚Äôm leaning toward to get out of the house is use my money from my last FFA show and buy a camper and go out of state to trade school for horseshoeing. I‚Äôve accepted the fact I‚Äôll have to give it up horses for a few years even if it kills me but financially it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best. I would pay 30k to cover school, food, living, and additional costs and be able to make anywhere from 40k-90k per year. I would hopefully like to be a more traditional wife and do more at home but I cannot depend on that and never will. I at least want SOME income, which is where that comes in. The cons are It‚Äôs hard on your body, which isn‚Äôt ideal for someone who wants to carry kids for their husband or wife, it‚Äôs slightly inconsistent, and while its both a pro and con, you are usually your own boss. 

Second, I‚Äôm considering going to community college for a year or two and out of state uni for the rest to be cheaper, however I don‚Äôt know how that would affect scholarships and such. I‚Äôll be applying to scholarships as soon as I learn how, and get time to when school starts since I work two jobs in the summer. Plus I have more time to decide my major instead of applying undecided. 

Lastly, Texas has decent universities, and I could apply to those and get my degree and travel after graduating college, but my main reason for seeking higher education is getting away and building something for myself. I just worry that I will be rushing into a decision that I‚Äôm not sure im ready for. Though I could probably bring my horse with me in the later years which would be fun. I also may find more connections with people since we are all from the same state. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. Truly. Any comments are appreciated and valued and again, I‚Äôm sorry for the long post. I‚Äôm just a lost 17 year old girl desperate to make a name for herself.

I already will be graduating with 17k in federal student loan debt and would prefer that over 25-26k. Especially since I plan to further my studies.

Positive: I could live with my family but my commute would be 40 min to an hour easily.

My family is willing to get me an ezpass, and they typically give me money for gas/in general per month. I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay tuition next semester + refund check, and for the spring I could take 6 classes and not have to pay for one out of pocket in the summer once I walk.

Negative: I‚Äôd have to quit my job on campus or at least take a sabbatical for the semester. I wouldn‚Äôt be working more than 12 hrs a week anyways if I stayed due to my internship but some money is better than none.

"ALL Pre-Meds Read (Pre-Med School Tier List and Advice)","This is kinda a long read and I'm trying to keep it as informal as possible.

As someone who has recently been accepted into a Top 5 MD school and has several joint publications with my peers at Washu and Yale I now feel like its my turn to guide aspiring pre meds on what to look for in universities and colleges around the US. 

DISCLAIMER: My word is not the end all be all as I am a stranger to you and everyones experience and circumstances are different. 

I will break this down into 6 sections from SS to F. I cannot include every single uni/college so I made a mix of some prestigious ones, elite state schools, state schools, top lacs, and some joke schools. I will break down a few metrics I used and point out some outliers in lower ranked schools on my list that I would consider more prestigious overall then the tier list entails .

Metrics - **Class size**, **access to research and clinical support/opportunities**, **medical school matriculation rate and population** (Note: Some schools don't offer committee  letters if you don't meet a certain gpa threshold. I took that into account when ranking schools that let's any student apply), **cost after both financial aid and subsidized  loans**, and lastly one of the most important factors **GPA Inflation/Deflation.**

(SS) - Duke, Harvard, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Washu, Yale

(S) - Emory, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, MIT, Notre Dame, Northwestern, UNC, Umich, Rice, USC, Vanderbilt, Williams, Amherst

(A) - Boston University, Columbia, NYU, UVA, Davidson, Georgetown, Princeton, Swathmore, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD

(B) - UIUC, Uchicago, Clemson, Drexel, Georgia Tech, GWU, Purdue, Rutgers, UC Santa Cruz, UGA

(B-) - Alabama, Auburn, Caltech, Ole Miss, Pepperdine

NO C

(D) Devry, University of Phoenix

(F) Trump University or any unaccredited school

Explanation on some schools 

PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU GET MAD THAT YOUR SCHOOL ISNT HIGHER

SS Tier - All these schools are indisputably the most prestigious and place the most students into T20 medical schools

S Tier - All of these schools could have an argument for sneaking their way into SS but there's a hang up or two that holds them back. For example, MIT/Northwestern/Cornells grade deflation or Umich/UNC/USC class sizes. A standout school that wasn't on my radar initially was Emory University, turns out while it only boasts a undergrad population of about 7300 it supplies more medical students every year then Duke, Harvard, Stanford, Penn, and Washu. That along with its proximity to CDC Headquarters, Emory Medical School (A t20) and the National Primate Institute makes it very strong. 

A Tier - All these schools have proven track records that will make medical school very accessible. Some schools that I know your surprised to see here are BU, Columbia, and UCLA. BU while definitively an undisputed pre med powerhouse its unfortunately coupled with both grade deflation and larger class sizes. UCLA makes it a little more difficult to be competitive for T20 medical schools due to the large classes and lack of research opportunities due to population size. HOWEVER, because it produces the most med students every year it makes me so indecisive about this spot that if one successful UCLA pre med tells me I'm wrong I will change it. Columbia while ivy and a top 20 medical student in conjucantion has a few things working against it. It's very harsh grading system, the ultra competitive pre med culture, and its very rigid core curriculum. Additionally, Columbia is affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center ‚Äî **but undergrads are at the Morningside campus**, not the medical school campus. It can take **time and effort** to arrange clinical volunteering or shadowing, especially without connections.

B - Some big state schools that aren't pre med focused and allocate more funding to other stem branches (UIUC, Gtech, Purdue). Uchicago one of the best univerties in the world is geared more toward academia and resaerch rather then medical school. That along with grade deflation makes it not so desirable. UGA is the outlier in this group and can have an argument for A tier but only for in state students.

B- - Schools not known for their pre med programs and lack in matriculation representation. Caltech is here and maybe a little unfairly but its just not a school thats meant to produce physicians. Its the pinnacle of academia and pushes its kids to their absolute best even at the sacrifice of their gpas. As Im writing this I realize that with how personal the class sizes are and the abundance of research I mightve categorized this wrong. Please let me know in the comments. 

D - Not respected as real institutions

F - Im not explaining this one

  
Last note - 

Any of these schools would be perfect if you got a full ride or reduced cost, ESPECIALLY your flagship universities. Community college is also very respectable and should be advised to minimize debt.

Please keep the comments respectful and I will try my best to respond to comments with serious questions.

"how do ppl have time to get everything done","I feel so irresponsible. I only work 27hrs a week and i work nights so i have the whole day before me. But i dont get shit done! it takes me forever to get anything done. I keep a planner bcs of my adhd and it helps significantly. 

In college i would literally forget to do the dishes for weeks. It was disgusting. 

I feel overwhelmed. How do ppl with 40+ hrs plus commute (15 min commute for me and i leave an hour early to make sure im gassed up for deliveries) fit everything? plus working out?

I Feel immature for not being able to keep up with it all. My mom gets annoyed when i forget to do laundry or dishes. I feel like im 21, im way too old for my mom to have to remind me. I know i have adhd and so i do struggle to remember. But i feel like theres not enough time in the day also. i barely relax or do hobbies anymore bcs i dont have time for them. But i only work 27 hrs!!! 

Mybe im not locking in hard enough. And adhd. Which im medicated for but its an addictive substance so i try to only take it at work (when i rlly need it) bcs i want to be careful 

i feel like a mess. Ik everyone just pretends to have it together, but i feel immature. All my friends work full time plus get all their shit done. And somehow still have time for hobbies and ten hours of doomscrolling a day!

"Burnout, fatigue, and wanting to do something else, but afraid of debt. Experiences or advice?","Since I graduated a few years ago, things have been good - I've gotten to travel, enjoy the money I made in my field. But I went through cycles of burnout and recovery and this one feels the most serious. I'm about to pay off my car but, I still have a lot of student loan debt and I want to go back to school for something else. Specifically, med school.

This last 2 years I've been focused on paying off as much debt as I could so I could finally be free and not feel like I had to stay anywhere I truly didn't want to because I had debt to pay off. At the same time, I love what I do but I dread coming into work more than not lately. I'm bored. I waste time at work because I finish my work so quickly. I feel hopeless. Like I'm going to just die here. I don't have motivation to do much outside of work except sleep and eat or the occasional workout. I miss my drive, my spark, and my joy for life (yes I'm on medication). I've been studying for a cert for slightly more pay and knowledge, but even then it's not truly what I want.

I haven't been working long enough to feel this way so I ask myself how do people do it for 20+ years at the same company? I have a good, well-paying, comfortable job. Why can't I be happy? What's wrong with me?

On top of that I had plans to try and buy a house in a few years, but I won't be able to do that if I go back to school. But the way I felt when I was considering this, it was like my world opened back up again. I saw a future, new challenges, growth, excitement. I stopped feeling trapped and suffocated by life. I started enjoying my job more because I knew I didn't have to stay here forever anymore. I had a way out. 

But...six figure student loan debt has been breathing down my neck. Although I can probably still work while I go to school I'll likely accumulate more debt and have to defer my current loans.

I'm 29, I wish I'd just gone for what I really wanted in the beginning.

"Is there ANY university out there that pays its employees for 90%+ masters program?","
Context: Im in IT working as a software eng 1 at a top 50 University. I want to pivot to my passion and pursue a masters degree in History. My problem is my university, and amongst every other one I‚Äôve checked so far, always comes with a HUGE catch. 

They are only willing to cover half the tuition for employees and you‚Äôre   only allowed to take 6 credit per semester(which means it would take 3+ years to graduate unless I‚Äôm Wrong?)

If a decent history job comes after graduating, I‚Äôll gladly take it despite the salary cut. I‚Äôve been in the industry for 9 years in Software Engineering and I‚Äôm ready to call it quits within the next 2. I have enough in savings and I don‚Äôt want to go through any debt. So can anyone please suggest me any Universities that offer 100% Aid with full course coverage online for their employees?

I‚Äôve done a lot of research but not all Universities are showing their tuition policy publicly. I just don‚Äôt want to do it at a cheap online University like WGU or ASU or Purdue.

I‚Äôve also asked ChatGPT and the answers are either mixed, inaccurate, or outdated. 

Additionally: Would rather not join a corporate company for their tuition benefits. There‚Äôs a serious lack of work-life balance with those guys.
And looming AI threats and countless lay offs. I want to keep my ducks in check.

"Is the Internet right about ""Why Major"" essays?","Currently working on the Georgia Tech supplemental, which is basically ""Why Major"" and ""Why Us"" combined into 300 words. I allocated around half my essay to explaining my interest in my major, and the second half about how Georgia Tech would be perfect for me specifically.

One thing I'm worried about though - I originally wrote the ""why major"" essay about one key extracurricular from high school using a narrative structure. While it wasn't the catalyst for my interest, it's a clear and impactful example of exactly why I'm interested in my major. I then connected various aspects of that EC and my specific interests within my major to niche offerings/courses/programs at Georgia Tech.

Then I went on Google, and it seems that everyone says that you should have a montage of chronological mini events instead of one main one (think building legos at 9, doing robotics in middle school, and engineering research in high school). When I tried that for my own, it felt a bit fake and I couldn't really go in depth about anything, but should I do my best to follow that format regardless?

"How do I throw out a giant failed fermentation mess?","Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

About a year ago some rain water leaked into a big tub of chicken food. I didn't want to waste it- it was close to 40lbs of feed- so I asked some chicken groups what to do and they said I could try completely submerging the feed in water and letting it ferment. They said it was easy and fool proof and I just had to remember to use it all up before it gets moldy.

Well, I should have known better. ADHD got the better of me, then anxiety, then the shame cycle. I currently have a plastic barrel with about 40lbs of chicken food and I-dont-even-know-how-many gallons of water sitting on my back porch turning into the scariest stink bomb ever \*and I have no idea what to do about it\*. It's so moldy it's turned completely black. Sometimes it bubbles and shifts on it's own. I opened the lid once and was hit by the gnarliest smell I've ever been subjected to. 

If I put it out with my trash are the garbage men going to hate me? Will they even take it? It's incredibly heavy- I could move it to the curb with a wagon but putting it in the back of the truck is going to be a nightmare. I considered trying to pour off some of the water but I'm worried it's going to kill my lawn and the stink is truly horrific and I don't want my neighbors to suffer. If I lived out in the country I wouldn't worry about digging a hole and dumping it in the woods but I live in a town with neighbors close by on all four sides. Plus I have two dogs who are absolutely the sort to give themselves food poisoning gobbling down rotten sludge. 

I thought about taking it directly to my county's waste processing center but I don't know how to find out if this is something they take. The idea of getting this into my car, driving it 30 minutes, and then getting turned away because they don't take toxic food sludge is unbearable.

It can be anything. But I'm curious if it could be something that meets people where they are. Like maybe what a more beneficial screen or app experience could look like? Something that would actually help you feel more alive, more real, more okay. 

Please share whatever comes to mind.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1mjfll4/what_is_the_one_thing_you_truly_need_right_now/","1754511803.0","GenZ","special_effects"
"Conservatory requiring 930 synchronous hours a year work out?","I am trying to figure out the weekly commitment of going back to school while working part time. I have been exploring several colleges that say classes are 9am-10pm including Saturdays. i understand this means that classes are available during those times but presumably we have some flexibility over our selections. I was told that in a year it would be 930 synchronous hours. If I am to assume the school year is 30 weeks (guessing) then this would work out at 31 hours per week, which is grueling and almost a full time job. Anyone else doing a conservatory or any other acting school that could tell me what the commitment is like in real terms. They all seem extremely intense. Unfortunately I can't just take casual classes as I need to use the GI Bill to pay for it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mjg6hj/conservatory_requiring_930_synchronous_hours_a/","1754513154.0","college","Jo_thumbell"
"How Should I Write/Format The Questbridge Additional Information Section?","I'm getting conflicting information on how this should be done (whether i should pursue the traditional personal statement narrative format where it's more essay-like, versus bullet points) and I'd really appreciate a bit of help.

  
I have several extenuating circumstances\* (read at the end of this cause its long ;-;) but I'm worried about cramming it within 400 words in a way that feels like I'm providing rampant excuses for my grades. How should I format this? Should each paragraph be allocated chronologically in terms of which events happened first, and ALSO how I overcame it? Or should it just be bullet points of things that happened? 

Thank you so much for your insight. 

  
\*Long list for context:

\- Mom was institutionalized for most of early childhood, has depression + panic anxiety 

\- Biological dad left for a mistress, ruining our income 

\- I found out I had ADHD sophomore year of HS 

\- CPS came to our house during sophomore year cause she had a particularly bad mental breakdown, which caused a dip in grades 

\- My geometry teacher was fired, and I rotated between 3 teachers freshman year, which caused a dip in my geometry grade and Regents scores

"Is 26 too late to go back to school?","Title says it all. I have my AA in Art/Design and have been working self employed full time since graduating with my AA, with random side jobs here and there. I spent the majority of my early twenties doing this and had a ton of fun BUT now I'm realizing I want more for myself and my future...

I want to set myself (and my future family) up for success with a high-paying job with benefits so I can have insurance, contribute to my retirement, and hopefully continue my higher learning with job-supported tuition reimbursement. I wasn't thinking about a future at all when I graduated high school and wasn't taking college seriously. Now I'm 26 with a solid life partner that inspires me to be my best self, and I am at this crossroads.

I know I can do more and learn more but how do I balance going back to school at this age with the family future I want to have? We planned to get married and start a family by the time I'm 30. We envision a lifestyle where I am home full time with our kids, at least until they are old enough for school.

If I go back to college, I'll finish by the time I'm 28/29, and then begin to enter the workforce at that time. If I try to do both, I'll only have about a year or two of working before I am pregnant and then unable to work full time, consistently.

How can I balance both, and what sacrifices must be made? If you've gone back to school at this age, and/or started a family in your late 20s too, how did you balance it? What did you have to sacrifice to do so? Any help will be greatly appreciated because I don't have anyone in my personal life I can talk to about this with actual lived experience.

**TL;DR:**¬†I'm 26 with an AA in Art/Design, have been self-employed since graduation, but now want a stable, high-paying career with benefits to support a future family. I'm considering going back to school but unsure how to balance finishing a degree, entering the workforce, and starting a family by 30 (with hopes of being a stay-at-home mom for a few years). If you‚Äôve gone back to school or started a family around this age, how did you manage both?

As a country, I don't understand why people think it's their choice if you should tan or not. I get this every summer from different people. Like I tan easily, and I'm not a fan of my hair and skin colour matching, I don't think it's a good look for me, which is why I avoid the sun and wear sun screen even during winter. But saying something like ""Yeah, no. Not a fan. You go out an enjoy yourself though."" Literally just noise. Doesn't process.

"A small rant","I don't know if this is just me, but for context I'm Asian American(this is pertinent), but I just feel kind of intimidated by white students.  And before anyone attacks me, I'm not saying I hate white people or I think they're all bad or anything like that!   
But as I've gone through schooling in the United States  I've just always felt myself shrink a little when I'm around white people- and I don't really mean all.  But it is generally the very like ""stereotypical"" white people or the ""popular"" students.  I don't even know how to explain this super well but I just feel myself getting really insecure or intimidated.    
It's strange because I've never really felt ashamed about being Asian so it's hard for me to even know why I get so intimidated or explain this super well.  But, I think a part of it might be that I have faced a lot of small and subtle micro-aggressions or just blatant racism and judgement, but I hate that I feel that way!  I mean I am just as capable and whatnot, I don't understand why I just shrink back so much and feel ""inferior"" I know I'm not, and I know that no one is superior or inferior because of their ace.

"Everything seems pointless","I‚Äôm a 17 year old and I‚Äôm very close to becoming an adult. I‚Äôm going to turn 18 soon, then I‚Äôll finish high school and finally ‚Äúgo out on my own‚Äù, but it all seems so pointless. If I go to college I‚Äôm in debt for the foreseeable future, I can‚Äôt even go to college where I want to because out of state tuition is too high for me to afford. So I‚Äôm going to be stuck in the same place I‚Äôve been all my life, in debt, and most likely miserable. It‚Äôs not even like I can avoid it by just not going to college, because then I‚Äôll be working a minimum wage job, barely scraping by on rent, constantly worried that if I lose my job I‚Äôm going to be homeless. I won‚Äôt even ever have security because if I ever want to get a house (aka somewhere I can‚Äôt just get evicted from at any time) that‚Äôs another lifetime of debt slapped on top of everything else. It won‚Äôt even be MY house, because it will have to be a mortgage, so it‚Äôs the same situation again, debt and no sense of security.

"What Happens to Gen Z Women Who Build Their Image on Beauty When They Start Aging and Face the Reality of How Men See Them?","
What do you think about women becoming more radical as they age and become invisible to men?

I wonder how women raised on Instagram, TikTok, and high beauty standards will feel when they start aging, hit menopause, and become invisible to men.

I understand that women don‚Äôt need male validation. However, when I look at young women and how much they build their value on beauty, how hard they try with makeup and beauty routines at such a young age, I worry about what will happen when they start aging. And to be honest, society is cruel to older women. Older women are invisible. Ads, fashion, and media barely feature them, only women who look 20, without a single wrinkle.

I don‚Äôt think women used to be this obsessed with beauty. In the past, women had unshaved legs and armpits, didn‚Äôt wear this much makeup, and didn‚Äôt follow a six-step skincare routine. They also didn‚Äôt rely on validation from men flooding their dating apps. So maybe, for Boomer women, aging wasn‚Äôt as shocking or painful.

But I‚Äôm really worried about how Gen Z women will handle this, especially since men find women most attractive around 25. Imagine all the TikTok girls who built their self-worth around their looks, and then they start aging, and the male attention disappears. Men's preferences are honestly cruel when it comes to aging. There are studies showing that across all age groups from 18 to 60, men rate 20-year-old women as the most attractive. A 40-year-old woman becomes invisible.

I‚Äôve read many posts from older women saying they feel like they‚Äôve lost that spark, that no man notices them anymore like they did when they were younger.

What will happen to Gen Z women? Do you think they‚Äôll become more radical or resentful toward men once they experience firsthand the reality that as men age, they still chase 18-year-olds, while 40-year-old women become invisible to them?

I didn‚Äôt know that the reward for getting an impressive amount of work done in one day was rewarded with more work because I can ‚Äúhandle it‚Äù.

"I‚Äôm blown away by how people do risky sex","Sex outside of marriage where pregnancy can be afforded? Sex outside of relationship where pregnancy can be afforded? Sex outside of people even knowing each other, where pregnancy can be afforded? Disagree morally with the previous 3, but it doesn‚Äôt quite baffle me.

The one that BAFFLES me is when people can‚Äôt afford it. (I‚Äôm morally against each of the following) condoms/IUD/pills don‚Äôt always work, pulling out doesn‚Äôt always work, abortion could become illegal very quickly. And then I think about ‚Äúeven if you could afford a kid, what if there‚Äôs twins or triplets?‚Äù  Like you are literally risking your livelihood over PIV sex. Let‚Äôs say they decide it‚Äôs best for the child to stay with other parent as you pay child support. What if you A lose your job and then B run into problems getting a modification to it? The other one that baffles me is sex when parents are home or even live at home, sex when the door is unlocked and anyone could be home, and obviously sex in public. I think just as mind blowing to me is that people introduce hookups to parents, and I‚Äôve seen a story of a guy who told his mom ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre just friends that sleep together I don‚Äôt wanna date her‚Äù

Mind you I‚Äôm not like ‚Äúew what‚Äôs wrong with these people‚Äù, but I physically feel my stomach drop hearing about these types of things
