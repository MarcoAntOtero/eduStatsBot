"identity crisis lol","Hello po mga ate and kuya! Im currently in SHS as a STEM student and I just need advice/help because God help me idk what to do with my life. I am currently experiencing major identity crisis eversince entering this SHS strand that I did not want. I was an A+ student, A leader, campus journalist, and many many things that i juggled all at once, now I feel so little and confused. 

Originally, I wanted to pursue HUMSS and Take BA COM as my first choice and BS EDUC major in English as my second moving forward to College. But I went off track because my mom didn‚Äôt agree and asked me to pursue stem instead. Now I am left with these questions in my head, I am left to wonder what I want. Teaching is my calling it, Everytime  someone were to ask me ‚Äú what do you wanna pursue?‚Äù I would always answer with ‚Äú I want to teach. I want to work with kids‚Äù. But many of the people I knew said that it was impractical, My mom even suggested Nursing, And although I have the highest respect for Nurses, I don‚Äôt wanna be a Nurse. The people close to me belittling what I want is so draining and im losing motivation bc I do not know what to do with my life.  

I‚Äôve been considering being an Occupational Therapist (BSOT) specifically to be a Pediatric Occupational Therapist. Is it worth it? I really want to work with kids and teach and help. My friends are also belittling and downplaying BSOT. please help a girl out bc atp I do not know what to do. my Identity Crisis bc of lack of support with what I want is through the roof. I know it‚Äôs my calling to do so. I think being in other fields beside that is going to drain the drive and motivation I have left.  

I just need an advice on wether I am making the right decision to move forward with this. I feel like my options are so limited. If you know anything that aligns with what I want please LMK. Help a confused girlie out. TYSM!  ","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lpxlgh/identity_crisis_lol/","2025-07-02 14:40:16","college","Ancient-Muffin-9335"

"I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind this upcoming semester","I (F21) just attended orientation for my university. I'm moving hours away from home to a city I‚Äôve visited a grand total of one time.

I'm a psych major who wants to go to grad school. I'm also the obnoxious student who's in 10 different clubs. Last year, while I was still in community college, I balanced Student Media, occasional student government meetings, PTK, helping to organize campus events, and SkillsUSA‚Äîall while taking classes, applying to multiple universities for transfer, and working on campus, sometimes up to 20 hours per week.

I blame this on my ADHD, really, because my brain goes, ""HEY, I WANNA DO THAT THING!

So I do the thing... kinda, sorta. I usually procrastinate, barely hold everything together, and break down every so often. But I do get it done, so yay?

So, as I'm leaving for university, I'm unfortunately taking my neuroticism with me. But I'm also severely burnt out. I have been for a while, really.

And yet, I‚Äôm actually really excited for school‚Äîmeeting new people, learning new things, research, all that fun stuff. I have a really weird love-hate relationship with academia.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôve already started stressing out, as orientation has been a huge information overload. Do I apply for internships right now? A job? Volunteer work? Organizations? What‚Äôs the appropriate level of proactiveness? Why am I the only loser attending any of the optional sessions?

Anyway, I'm seeing a therapist on Wednesday, but I‚Äôd love to hear any advice from people who‚Äôve been in university longer‚Äîpreferably if you‚Äôre anything like me (I‚Äôll pray for you)‚Äîon how you manage your schedule between class and extracurricular activities.

Or is any of this stuff even worth it in the long run?","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1loicnl/im_afraid_im_going_to_lose_my_mind_this_upcoming/","2025-06-30 20:30:05","college","moonchildvii"
"I can't focus on anything, and it's killing me slowly.","I swear, I've tried everything to make myself work on my english assignments. Attempting to schedule my day, isolating myself from any distractions, trying to meditate and refocus myself between studying and working, but every time I just feel more tired and unmotivated to work on anything, even personal hobbies I keep telling myself I want to do. Instead, I just fall back to watching some stupid video or playing some game I'm never good at, and every time, I scream at myself for being such a failure. Every time I try to open my overdue essay, I can't help but feel a awful wave of nauseating regret for what I've done to myself, and even still I cannot seem to focus and work on it.
The few folks I know are much too busy with their schedule to help, and even then, all I get is ""just do it"" or ""use A.I"" (my professors explicitly use a.i detectors).
If things don't go well, then this will be the third college-level english class I've failed, so can someone please give advice on how to get out of this rut I've found myself in.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lohkhx/i_cant_focus_on_anything_and_its_killing_me_slowly/","2025-06-30 19:59:51","college","VNNNNVN"
"I‚Äôm switching paths‚Äîneed help choosing a major.","Hi all, I‚Äôm currently studying in Italy in a bachelor‚Äôs program called *‚ÄúSocial Innovation, Communication, and New Technologies‚Äù*. It‚Äôs an interdisciplinary degree mixing computer science, design, and social sciences. I originally picked it with the goal of becoming a UX designer or digital marketer‚Äîsomething job-ready and practical.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve realised I don‚Äôt want to work in tech or design anymore. What I really care about is **academia**, **research**, and working in institutions like the **EU**, **UN**, **NGOs**, or **think tanks**. I want to do a **master‚Äôs (probably abroad)**, then hopefully a **PhD**. Ideally I‚Äôd like to end up in Belgium, the Netherlands, or maybe stay in Italy.

Right now, I‚Äôm torn about what to do. My current degree feels too applied, and I‚Äôm seriously considering switching to something like:

* **Political Science**
* **Sociology**
* **Economics**
* or even **History** (though it feels a bit abstract and less ‚Äúmarketable‚Äù)

The upside is that I‚Äôm not taking on any debt (I get a stipend) and both my BA and MA would be **fully funded in Italy**, so I have flexibility. I just don‚Äôt want to waste time in a degree that won‚Äôt get me where I want to be.

So‚Ä¶ what major is best for my goals? How do I know what‚Äôs truly right for me?

Would love to hear from anyone in similar fields or paths.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lnw8nc/im_switching_pathsneed_help_choosing_a_major/","2025-06-30 02:22:56","college","Thecrazypacifist"
"I feel like a loser for taking more time to graduate","Trigger warning (in case): Depression   
  
  
TLDR: I failed my first attempt at my bachelors thesis and I am depressed and ridden with guilt and fear of breaking the news to my parents.   
  
Hi everyone, I (22F) started college September 2021 for my bachelors degree in International Business. Currently I am in my fourth and final year and we have to do a thesis and a defense as our final projects with an external company. Unforunately, I got the news recently that I failed my recent attempt at my thesis report so therefore, I won't qualify for a defense, and will have to attend a feedback session next week to get information on how to improve on my next submission which will be in September. Sure, it is only 2 months and that's hardly a delay but I still feel like a loser as people around me of course are passing one by one and are graduating in July which was supposed to be me but not now. 

For more context, the way it works at my uni is to do an internship in my first semester of my fourth year and then a thesis project with preferably the same company or different. Luckily, I was able to get an extension with the company that I was already with as they liked my work and the team also liked me.  
  
This entire process was super difficult as I was working as an intern still at that company 32 hours a week, I also had to attend some classes for uni in between, I was also taking language lessons in between as I was also planning to get a permanent residence card of the country where I am currently located in as I have lived there long enough and are eligible.   
  
I realized too late that I was burning out rapidly and I already struggle with depression and anxiety and my home life isn't great either as I still live with my parents. I honestly dropped the ball during the process. I take full accountability, but it still hurts. I have let down myself, my parents and some lecturers who really believed in me and my potential. I still need to break the news to my parents as well but I am so scared and my mental health has deteriorated so much in the past months that I am also in therapy now with the emergency hotline. 

I do want to graduate. I‚Äôve already been accepted into a pre-master‚Äôs program I wanted but I have to postpone that now to the next academic year and also my parents who pay for my tuition have to pay for an extra 2 months and I just feel so guilty.

Too hot outside, too lonely. I want something to do! I want a regular routine! I love my family but I'm in another state and I miss all my friends and the things I love. I miss the school of music, I miss my (frat) brothers, I miss marching on the field during Saturday nights or losing my voice in the stands at basketball games taunting the other team. I love my family and I'm glad to spend time with them but college has been my home the past year. I felt seen there.

"I don‚Äôt know what to do and need some advice","Hello sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors I‚Äôm typing this super late from where I‚Äôm at but I need some advice. I‚Äôm a rising senior and switched my major from computer science to data science, although they are similar data science at my school has a lot more courses. I‚Äôm also a dual major but I‚Äôm finishing that major up quickly. I planned on taking 3 more semesters so I could graduate a semester later. However I got super tired and depressed and couldn‚Äôt really take any of my classes that semester and withdrew from 2 courses. My biggest fear is that was going to happen again as that semester was super light and I still ended up dropping classes. I planned on taking summer classes so I could catch up. 1 of the courses which I just finished was just a fun class nothing related to my major and taking a calculus 3 course which isn‚Äôt going terribly. However I haven‚Äôt had a break from classes since my freshman year summer . I found out I start my second semester today technically and I broke down crying unsure if I can even make it through. The break I had was 3 days in between the semester and those were technically exam days.The class doesn‚Äôt have the best rating however if I don‚Äôt take it this semester I will have to take it this fall with 2 more difficult courses. Either way if I do decide to drop I will overthink and stress about the following semester and repeat my mistakes. Other than that the financial aid aspect is worrying me but I think I can handle that if I do decide to drop. However what really worries me is my mother. She doesn‚Äôt mind how long I take on my degree but doesn‚Äôt like me dropping classes. I don‚Äôt really understand but dropping those classes this winter made her kind of disappointed and I‚Äôm already not in a place where I can handle that. However cause of my decisions taking classes this summer, withdrawing those classes was kind of useless. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I just want to graduate and be over with school but I don‚Äôt have much experience with jobs, internships, or clubs. It is kind of hard since I commute to school and can‚Äôt really attend late events and even if I could I‚Äôm just always so tired. My other major doesn‚Äôt really have any job prospect without doing an additional degree. My school is extremely rigorous and if I don‚Äôt put any effort failing is an option ,since 70% of the course is graded on just exams and there are 2 exams. What even more insane is that this course has a higher rated professor this summer than the fall but when one is rated 2.9 and the other 2.3 are the prospect really great.

I‚Äôm I‚Äôm a psych major on the pre-med track, about to start junior year. I haven‚Äôt failed any classes, but my GPA isn‚Äôt great, and I know I‚Äôll need to take a gap year before applying to med school.

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling super unsure about everything. I‚Äôm still set on medicine, but I‚Äôm worried that I won‚Äôt get the strong bio background I want through psych alone. I‚Äôve mostly been a B student in science, and it‚Äôs making me question if I‚Äôm learning enough. ( Everyone that Ik is doing some kind of advanced bio research, while ive been doing qualitative psychology and public health research ( primarily environmental scans))

At the same time, I‚Äôve gotten really interested in coding and data science. I want to declare a data science minor, but doing that means I probably can‚Äôt fit in more bio classes. I‚Äôm torn, because data science feels useful and genuinely fun to me.

TL;DR: I want to take more bio to feel stronger for med school,(I want to do wet lab in undergrad) but I‚Äôm also really into data science. Anyone else been in this boat? What would you do?

"My summer is miserable, help needed.","Hi, hope everybody's doing well.

I finished my GCSEs three weeks ago, and since I had to do 7 subjects within a year (I am an international student with no prior experience receiving secondary education in the UK which made it even harder for me) I naturally wanted to take a break during the summer holidays. I literally was studying insane amounts every day--I can't even remember a single day off I took last year. Thanks to this relentless grind, I scored 9s in every test, every quiz I took in school. However, quite obviously, I was so burnt out by mid-June. This was especially true bc last year was my first time living abroad away from my parents. So I was defo ecstatic to return home and finally enjoy life.

But guess what my parents decided to hit me with? 2hrs of AS content lesson 6 days a week. Plus they expect me to study 8 hrs every day. According to them those hours consist of: 2hrs lesson + 2hrs ucat practice + 2hrs reading + 2hrs tutor hw. Simply unrealistic!

And when I told them that this was too much, they told me that people my age were studying all day without even getting sufficient sleep. I swear I told my mum I just want to study 4hrs each day, but she started shouting, saying that a high schooler just mustn‚Äôt take on that type of complacent attitude.I told my parents I really needed this summer break to wind down in order to prevent burnout next year, hoping for some sympathy from them. But what I heard from them was: ‚ÄúEven though you take the summer off, things won‚Äôt be that different next year. And you don‚Äôt want people that studied hard over the summer to be better than you, do you?‚Äù

Whenever I look at my friends being carefree and enjoying their summer, I have to hold myself from bursting into tears. Studying has become a dreadful chore from something I genuinely had a passion for. And because I need to juggle SO MUCH all at once, I truly cannot focus on one task and I ACTIVELY FEEL my productivity declining.

It's not that I don't want to study or prepare for my future during the holidays. My goal was to immerse myself into dentistry (what I wanna do in uni) and read a lot of related books and articles. Perhaps do some work experience, and lightly skim over A-level content. I wanted to focus less on academics and genuinely have fun for once! But what I have to do right now is defo far away from what I envisioned. I mean, how am I even supposed to maintain my sanity with so much homework and pressure? Even when I asked my parents to reduce lessons they said they already paid the tutor so can't get a refund, and I was being too weak.

What can I do?? My life is miserable, I'm getting nothing done, and I hate how my summer is ticking past filled with rotten time. Genuinely, any advice would be appreciated.

"RS Advice. I‚Äôm too ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù","Hey. I‚Äôm ngl this post is going to be all over the place as i‚Äôm writing this while i‚Äôm on a walk and have to pay around my surroundings. 

Background info: Okay so me and my gf (both 18) began dating in september 2024 and already graduated may 2025. The issue is , she‚Äôs friends (or was) with this guy (we‚Äôll call John) she‚Äôs known since freshman year. See , this whole issue started before we took an ap calc test in April , when john had walked up to me and told me ‚ÄúAye your girl has been looking at me a lot‚Äù and since him and i are friends, I just made up some bs response but after, I messaged my gf. She ended up sending multiple messages saying how she just zoned out and how the seating arrangement makes it so that they look at each other when they look up. I believe her because I remember last year, she would zone out a lot and stare at me or others for a while. During lunch, I didn‚Äôt really mention it until we got to our study hour/period and I had asked to see the messages they had. I almost cried reading them while in class, as her messages seemed more engaging than the ones with ours. She had used more emojis, showed larger responses (instead of crying emojis like she just does with me when i tell her a story) and she has a custom emoji that‚Äôs popping its head out of a cardboard box. It‚Äôs meant to be cute, and she used it with him. All of that really almost made me tear down as the way she messaged him, was the way she messaged me while we were still talking, and it felt like I was seeing the person i fell in love with, talk to someone else that way (if that makes sense). I didn‚Äôt do much after this. Just handed her the phone back but after school ended and we got home, we talked about it again. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want me to worry, she apologized and she also blocked him. Unfortunately, I decided to make it seem like it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal so I told her ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to as summer is about to start and it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôll see our classmates again‚Äù. This made her end up unblocking him and like I said, they continued to message more. So after this, they would talk more and on this Wednesday, he came up to me and told me ‚ÄúYour girl made me feel bad today because she asked me to get her a piece of paper and I said that she could get it herself‚Äù ‚Ä¶ after that, I got irritated with her. I told her why it was so easy for her to go back on her word ‚Äúnot talking to him and keeping him blocked‚Äù so this turned into an argument (she wasn‚Äôt arguing, it was her apologizing but she still didn‚Äôt block him. She actually blocked him after she asked him for help for a math test and I found out (by him) and that was the final time they talked. FYI I had no idea she blocked him until a week later when we were using each other‚Äôs phones as we didn‚Äôt have a lecture for AP lit. I decided to snoop around and found out that she was still talking to him and I told her ‚Äúyou said you wouldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore‚Äù she started saying that she didn‚Äôt but the messages were RIGHT in front of me so I couldn‚Äôt believe her at all. After that, I just gave her back the phone and I was quiet the entire time. Trying not to cry. I wanted to break up with her at that moment because she had gone back on her promise each time and did exactly the opposite of what she wanted to. I started writing on my notes app so that after class I could show it to her and break up and that‚Äôs exactly what I did. We didn‚Äôt break up as we sorta talked things out but she showed me that he indeed was blocked for over a week (and at first I didn‚Äôt believe she would keep him blocked but a few weeks later I checked his contact and he was still blocked). Oh I just remembered this, but this guy had an ex that he still talks about til this day but he‚Äôs honestly so weird talking to my girl like that but not with any of his friends. He‚Äôs so dry with them yet he isn‚Äôt with my girl. Not only that, he told her ‚Äúyou make these classes so much fun‚Äù even though he has classes with all his friends AND sits with them. He even has read receipts off for multiple people but not my girlfriend. Another thing is, we had a big test for one of our AP classes for december as it was finals and the teacher wanted it to be 2 at a table (as it‚Äôs a small amount of students in that class) and I was sitting in the corner waiting for my gf to arrive. She did but she ended up sitting next to HIM. Later that day, she also told me that they were both talking but she didn‚Äôt want to tell me what it was so I had to force it out of her and it wasn‚Äôt anything bad, it was just something she did she was embarrassed of and that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt want me to know. Another thing, she has this nickname she called him by (it was a freshman year class they had together and everyone did so idk if it‚Äôs right to be upset at this), one time after school, he waved bye at us but she thought he waved only at me so she yelled out ‚ÄúWow no Bye for me?‚Äù and thus other time during one of their convos, she asked what he had her as and she wasn‚Äôt happy with her contact so she said ‚Äúchange itüôÑput me as your fav best friend‚Äù‚Ä¶ funny considering that she‚Äôs against me having a girl bsf and i even blocked one of my female friends the moment she told me to AND i stuck to that promise. she‚Äôs still blocked. Alright so back to the main story, As we were in the library taking one of our AP exams, they sat next to each other while i sat a row behind them (seated by last names) so halfway through the test, I noticed that he had given up and he would turn to the side and smile at my gf and i couldn‚Äôt see what she was doing but I was certain she smiled back. I got pissed but I couldn‚Äôt do anything and then I saw that he was writing to her on the calculator and that made me even more mad. After the test, I just left her and went to class but I decided to come back to her coz she was waiting for me and wanted to talk. I told her how I saw her talking to him and all that and she denied it. I told her ‚ÄúWant me to ask him?‚Äù and she said yes. I asked him on imessage and she said ‚Äúyea your girl told me that you‚Äôre fine with me talking to her (he misread it coz she wrote to him on the palm of her hand) and that you think she‚Äôs cheating on you‚Äù. when I read that to her she smiled to hide the awkwardness I guess and I asked her why she had lied to me and I forgot what she said but I was pissed and basically started calling her a cheater. After that, she started crying and saying how she‚Äôs not a cheater and I told her to just reverse the roles and she said yea she wouldn‚Äôt be happy but I wouldn‚Äôt be a cheater. I told her she had lied to me and still engaged in a convo with him even tho she said she wouldn‚Äôt and she broke her promise multiple times. After this, she never talked to him again and I do remember before we graduated, we were taking pics for our ceremony and we were with a few friends. He walked up to us and he was looking at her a bit but she pretended to be on a phone call so he wouldn‚Äôt talk to her. 


Main thing:
Okay so after all of that background info, I‚Äôm writing this because even though it‚Äôs been months, I had a dream about it last night. It continues to haunt me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. The dream was that during one of our experiments for bio, the teacher assigned both of them to go take this bottle filled with soil and put it in the science room we have.

"I‚Äôm Utterly, Completely, Almost Paralyzingly Nervous About Track and College‚Ä¶ and I Feel Like It‚Äôs Consuming Me","I don‚Äôt even know where to start with this, but I‚Äôve been carrying this constant, lowkey panic for months and I guess I just need to put it out into the universe, even if it‚Äôs just Reddit. Maybe someone out there feels the same way.

I‚Äôm a high school student, I run track ‚Äî mostly sprints ‚Äî and I‚Äôm in that weird, terrifying stage where everything in my life feels like it‚Äôs supposed to be coming together‚Ä¶ but instead it feels like it‚Äôs all unraveling in slow motion.

Track is one of the only things I really *care* about. Not just for fun ‚Äî I care about it because it feels like my ticket to something more. College, opportunity, proving to myself and everyone else that I can be good at something. I‚Äôve been grinding for months, training, running, lifting, obsessively tracking my times. I‚Äôve made progress, sure, but it never feels like *enough*.

I stalk other kids‚Äô track times online. I see people my age running insane times ‚Äî times that feel worlds away from me ‚Äî and it makes me spiral. I start thinking, ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm just not cut out for this? What if no coach ever looks twice at me? What if I spend all this time, all this energy, all this *hope*, and I still end up being the kid who couldn‚Äôt quite make it?‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just track, though. College in general feels like this massive, looming deadline that‚Äôs creeping closer every single day. Applications, essays, financial aid, scholarships ‚Äî it‚Äôs *so much*. And I don‚Äôt have the luxury of not caring. I come from a background where college isn‚Äôt just some rite of passage ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival. It‚Äôs opportunity. It‚Äôs supposed to be the thing that changes everything.

But here I am, barely holding it together, feeling like every decision I make right now could screw up my entire future. My grades aren‚Äôt perfect. My times aren‚Äôt perfect. My confidence is non-existent half the time. Meanwhile, it feels like everyone else has it figured out ‚Äî they‚Äôre getting recruited, their parents know how to navigate the system, they‚Äôre visiting campuses and casually dropping ‚Äúsafety schools‚Äù like they aren‚Äôt also $80,000 a year.

And me? I‚Äôm sitting here refreshing recruitment forms, watching my PRs like they‚Äôre the stock market, googling ‚Äúhow fast do you need to be to get recruited‚Äù for the millionth time, and losing sleep over whether I‚Äôll ever be good enough.

Sometimes I lie awake at night running through all the possibilities in my head. What if I train harder? What if I drop X seconds off my 400m? What if I email the right coach at the right time? But there‚Äôs always that whisper of doubt in the back of my head saying‚Ä¶ what if none of it matters?

I want this so badly it physically hurts some days. But wanting something isn‚Äôt enough. And that terrifies me.

Anyway‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my confession. I‚Äôm nervous. I‚Äôm scared. I feel overwhelmed and behind and small. But I‚Äôm still trying. Even if it feels impossible some days.

If anyone else feels like this, you‚Äôre not alone. I guess that‚Äôs the only comfort I have right now.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1ln7645/im_utterly_completely_almost_paralyzingly_nervous/","2025-06-29 05:42:30","highschool","Supremacy_123"
"For any high schoolers on here, does anyone else feel intimidated by school work and smart students to the point where they cry about it?","Before high school, I went to a Catholic grade school and then transferred to a public high school about 2 years ago (because I was having severe problems with the principal and some of the kids there). However, when I went there, I felt dumb because all the kids were smarter than me and the education system at the public elementary and middle schools kinda prepared them for high school. My dad also pressures me to take really hard classes and hopefully get high grades in them, but I just can't do it. I barely get a B in them and all the smart-ass kids (who I'm in the class with) get an A in them. It's fucked up and a lot of teachers don't understand my circumstances because they assume I should be like all the smart kids and am just not trying hard enough. I do want to do well in school and get into a good college, but, due to these circumstances, it's way too hard, especially for someone like me, who probably has undiagnosed anxiety and probably autism. I just want to fucking give up. Why am I so dumb? Why am I this way?

They have no money and yet they spend on weed, takeouts almost every day and the newest ridiculous idea....a f*cking chinchilla. 
He told me this just yesterday that his ex was buying a chinchilla. On it's own it's, okay fine. But when you consider they have a 7 yr old, a couple thousand dollar a month mortgage, a hot tub they are paying monthly for, four cats (two of which are ancient and poorly), one dog, two chameleons and lots of fish in several tanks you start to think, huh...so...what the hell is this? They don't have amazingly paid jobs, in fact he's currently unemployed. In massive debt. I don't understand how she thinks getting a chinchilla is a good idea! They don't walk their dog, barely look after the animals or house. 
When is enough, enough? How can I tell my friend that this isn't healthy and she's going to make that house even more gross and unkempt with more animals that they can't afford to look after! I'm worried about their kid, who is autistic and is not growing up in a safe, tidy house. It is truly gross. Routinely animals mess in there. Should I get firm with him? Or should I just butt out?

"Anxiety attack over gifts","Mandatory preamble, I have issues other than just Anxiety and am working on getting better with therapy and meds among other things. 

I wanted to vent on one of the ways anxiety hits me in a way people without anxiety just simply don't understand. I hate being given gifts. The obvious way people would think this causes anxiety is I am now on the hook to reciprocate. While that can be anxiety inducing, that's future me problem, it isn't the main cause of anxiety for me when it comes to being given a gift.

Now I feel obligated to show interest in the gift, show appreciation for it, and then use the gift. If the gift is something that I don;t want, I now have to fake all of this and that takes a lot more effort. Some days, I just don;t have it in me to do this. And if I were to say ""thank you but no thank you"", I come off as the asshole for snuffing their gift and brushing off the time and energy they spent on getting it for me. This is a day that's supposed to be celebrated and now I am an asshole ruining it for everyone. This is what is going through my head as I now sit in my room suffering an anxiety attack. And it's all lies. The person giving the gift isn't insulted. It was a nice gesture. And now I have gone and ruined it all because my brain can't seem to understand that I am not under constant threat.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lq1mr1/anxiety_attack_over_gifts/","2025-07-02 17:17:06","Adulting","Sjksprocket"

Too old to connect to anybody lower than 20 but too young to relate to the 30+ crowd. Feels like everybody in their 20's are either in school, clubbing or staying inside because their broke (me included). People at work are so much older than me I can't try to connect to anybody there either and I feel like a little kid compared to them.

Just wish I could find the answer to meeting people my age. I'm going back to school in a year max so maybe I can start connecting to people again?

"How do you deal with overwhelm and stress that is making you plan & write a scide note daily?","I'm a doctoral student almost finishing my studies (about less than 2 months left). I live on campus, and since I won't be a student anymore, I need to get a new place. I also don't have a job lined up. I live in Canada. The housing market is awful here. I have some money saved up (covers one year of rent), but will anyone rent to someone unemployed? I have a good credit score (800s). 

I can also probably find a part time job for the next four months, but I need actual employment. I'm not above washing dishes, but I've never had a regular job where I had to stand for long hours or do physical tasks. I'm a woman, 31, and I am out of shape af. I've also never had a job that wasn't academic (teaching, tutoring). I can't teach because my degrees are all engineering. Nothing in education. 

I'm also on a few medication (mental health and diabetes meds) that my student insurance covers. No longer a student? No job? No insurance. Good luck paying $500 for medication monthly! I also don't have a license (fear of driving from an accident when I was a teenager and learning to drive). I have a bike and where I live is kind of bike friendly, until of course rain and snow start. Worst case scenario, I can walk or just use public transport at times. 

I don't know what to do. I don't have many friends. I've been looking on FB marketplace and it's depressing. Most places with lower rent are looking for students and are like 5 people living in the same house and the other 4 are dudes. Nothing wrong with having male roommates, I've had male roommates before but not 4 to 1. That's terrifying tbh - mostly just the energy and cleanliness. No offense. 

I don't know what to focus on right now. I can't find a place without a job, and I can't find a job without finishing my degree and it seems like there may not be many jobs to begin with (I'm mostly looking at data science jobs, I have an industrial engineering background). Academic jobs are terrifying because I don't feel ready yet (despite having experience as a lecturer and a researcher). Postdocs aren't readily available either. The tech job market is terrifying. 

I'm honestly crumbling. To make it all worse, I'm dealing with some traumatic personal stuff related to family living through war as well (don't ask). I haven't slept more than 5 hours in weeks. I'm averaging 2 and a half hours. I'm self medicating with Tylenol and Benadryl to sleep, waking up drowsy and groggy everyday but it's the only way I can get that 3 hours of sleep. My blood pressure is 140 over 90. My heart rate is constantly high. I can't keep food down. That is if I can eat any... 

I'm so stressed out, I can't even focus on the things I need to do which is submitting my research, networking, looking for a place, figuring out what to sell/how to move my stuff, studying for interviews, applying to and finding jobs to secure a job while doing my current part time contract job...I just can't do anything. Instead, I shut down and scroll away the days or just stare at the ceiling unable to do anything. 

Open instagram to get bombarded with ""how AI is taking your job"" - the job I've been training for for 10 years, and never got to have. 

How do I save myself here? Please. Please help me figure this out. I have no one I can rely on. I'm genuinely worried that I'm going to do something drastic.

Welp, I dropped my neuroscience concentration - sort of impulsively, but it may have been a long time coming - because I realized/admitted I didn't like it enough to tolerate a PhD/career in it. In studying neuro, I had intended to complete a PhD and attempt to break into pharma somewhere down the line. English, however - I couldn't be more obsessed with it (and have been since childhood), and (if all goes well) I'll be completing an undergraduate thesis and mayyybe a PhD in English (I genuinely really want to, but if it's either academia, the prospects for which are pretty abysmal right now, or being overqualified for jobs, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Still might do it, though lol). Thing is, I'll have accumulated about $130k worth of student loan debt upon graduating, and my parents cosigned my loans. I'm actually scared out of my wits that I'll be delinquent and they'll have to bear responsibility. Also, I'm not sure if I can re-add my neuroscience concentration at this point - I'm only halfway through its requirements either way - or if I even want to.

First few years went to a university on scholarship to play volleyball, quit, took a break for a year, transferred to a community college since it was more affordable, and have changed majors maybe 3 times. The first program i was interested in ended up being way too hard for me, i‚Äôve never been the smartest in math so whatever class i needed for that major, i dropped it. Tried another in the health field, didn‚Äôt work out. Really wanted to be a physical therapist but the program was so competitive i didn‚Äôt get in, which didn‚Äôt make sense to me since i was obviously new, so i had to give that up.

I think because i just picked IT as a last resort and from the pressure of my parents I haven‚Äôt been as passionate about school anymore and in general just feel like it‚Äôs not for me. Right now i am 70% done until i graduate but i still feel like i am not qualified to go in the real world to get a real job. I have taken majority of my classes online and sometimes on campus just due to my work schedule that always changes with each job i get. I am always told that campus classes are better but i think my main problems is how i study. My attention span with studying is 2hrs max. Reading the textbook is boring so i try to make it kind of fun by typing out my notes on the important things..but then i feel like im wasting my time doing that since i take forever to get thru a chapter, so then i go back to just only reading but get bored again and then just give up. I also work early hours at my job and then after im too tired to do anything but nap, but then i stress myself out knowing i wont get enough time to study before dinner if i do take a nap. Idk i guess where im going with this is what are some better ways to study to have a better attention span ? How can i push through the rest of my college days on a more positive note ?

"Telling my AP that I want to change my major...","Previously a Architectural Engineering Major (I chose this major because my dad told me to pick a major that would pay me 65000+, and it was also what I was mildly interested in) going to a community college, I want to change to Psychology. I hated AE for 2 years (been going for 3) and am supposed to transfer to another college next semester. My parents also want me to apply for an intership this summer. Truth is, I loved Psychology (interest started in Middle School, peaked in Highschool) and want to get a connected degree (Human Services to Psychology). I also have ADHD, so it's harder to concentrate and complete assignments on time (sometimes I need reread a page dozens of times to understand it). I also noticed that I was so interested in it that I didn't burn out during the middle of the semester like I usually do and managed to hold until the last two weeks where I slowed down (still passed). 

My APs hate each other and only stay together for my younger brothers (youngest is 10). My AF is emotional distant with my mom (also his mother treated my mom badly and he did nothing). My AM hates that my father (who works 7 days a week 8-10 hours) doesn't do considerate things (washing dishes, loading dishwasher, etc.).

My AF is already mad that I'm taking longer than the ""needed"" years (taking 5 years instead of 4) to finish my study (they don't understand that credits are what counts the most). My AM mentioned a few times that once I graduate, to get an apartment and take her away from my AF. Though, she (probably calmed down after seeing the rent prices) hasn't mentioned it for months. 

For reference, my mental health got so bad last year (summer through fall semester), that I got suicidal to runaway to deciding to stay after speaking to a counselor (college provides mental health service). There's also finances to consider. My father constantly asked if I applied for a loan (which I have not done yet). I was planning to pay it through, semester tuition is 2000-2500 for full-time students. There is also the fact that they want me to take 4 classes a semester, something I now understand that I really can't manage, 3 is my max. But they refuse to learn about or see the symptoms of ADHD.

I know I can't delay this much longer and need to tell them. My original plan was to email or text them this information while I was at work or something. Since I've been keeping this to myself, my anxiety and stress level is through the roof.

"It‚Äôs probably my fault but I just needed to see if anyone else has been here.","Not sure what to say really but I just wanted some outside opinions because I‚Äôm going crazy and it‚Äôs only like 2 months into dealing with this community college.

So this is my first year and first semester right now, before this I had no experience with college let alone the (very) shitty website this school provides and expects us all to use for EVERYTHING from scheduling classes to communicating with advisors. Literally anything I try to do in person is met with ‚ÄúYou have to go to the website and do XYZ‚Äù which has been really frustrating because the website is glitchy, inefficient, and confusing to navigate. Anyways since it‚Äôs my first experience with college in general I relied heavily on my advisor to help me plan and schedule my classes, and I made him very aware that I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do or how to do it considering the only help I have in my life are people who went to college over thirty years ago and don‚Äôt understand the technology aspect. He decided that based on that information he was gonna place me into accelerated classes that only run for 6 weeks and are incredibly difficult. Me, a freshman student. On top of that they weren‚Äôt even general education classes like English or math, they‚Äôre difficult and essential classes.

At that point in time I hadn‚Äôt realized the difficulty level involved in those accelerated classes, I assumed ‚ÄúOh, well they ARE intro classes so they probably won‚Äôt be that difficult hence the accelerated option being chosen for me‚Äù Fast forward to now and the classes are wrapping up and I feel like I got screwed over immensely and I‚Äôm very frustrated. For example my forensics class had a test every two weeks, however each test was 80 questions long and covered at least 7 chapters. I didn‚Äôt do well on a single one, the highest score I received was 71%. This was on top of multiple weekly assignments, however that part was totally fine and I did very well on.

I just don‚Äôt understand how my advisor expected me to do this?? Or anyone for that matter unless they‚Äôre just retaking the class. I‚Äôm confused and upset. Can I not truly not rely on anyone to do their job or help me navigate this difficult process that my future relies on? Like why would my advisor hear the info about me and decide that‚Äôs the best course? Also for others in accelerated classes do your professors also give you 3 or more separate tests that consist of at least 80 questions each with only two weeks in between? Or is that a fucking lot because it sure feels like it??

"how do I distinguish my academic failures from my own personal self worth?","I've posted here before about constantly failing my classes or even training programs, and im wondering how do you guys cope with failing? the reason why I ask this is because,

I genuinely can't see myself as not being an utter failure when I cant pass quizzes, or don't understand the assignments. I even argued with my therapist about it cause, yes im grateful for the job stability I have now, got my license finally after years of trying, yet I still feel like a massive loser because every failure along the way has been marked onto me and I cant Help but be reminded of them all whenever I attempt college. I was in college for 4 years and never made it to the second semester of my program cause I couldnt get a B in most of the classes, so I tried only doing 1 class and I still failed, I tried a workforce program in my college and failed that as well. Now im just feeling stuck and stupid because no job pays more than I already make without requiring a certificate, degree, or experience. Like, How do you not feel like a failure after everything you try doesn't work? sorry for the rant

"Please be blunt with me‚Äì do I have a shot at getting into a good graduate school program? (LONG post)","I'd ask r/college, but they delete everything when I talk about my mental health. Fair warning for mentions of suicide, drugs, and abuse. I won't be going into too much detail, because that's gruesome.

So, when I hit high school, my mom turned to drugs which made her violent and abusive (to the point I had to worry about my life). This screwed over my high school GPA, which was a 2.4 (weighted).

So I went to community college, broke and unprepared, because I needed to get out of that abusive household. But because I was so unprepared, I failed all of my classes my first semester. I was also hospitalized for mental health reasons that semester, which caused me to give up and fail.

I retook all of my classes next semester and ended up getting around a 3.2~ish? So, not bad. Nothing below a B-. I did finish this semester, but around April after my finals, I attempted suicide. I lived (duh), but I never told anyone until a year later and I never went to the hospital for it, so nobody knew. All of my credits taken so far have been for either my biology major or general education. Nothing related to my current major.

I continued through online college, and decided to transfer when I had around a 3.0. Really not great, but not that bad. I transferred to a university that wasn't my first choice, but it was better than nothing. I was an animation major (I had no clue what I was doing, and I really thought an animation degree from a mediocre Midwest university would get me somewhere), so a lot of my credits from here were related to animation.

That year (2023/2024) I got hospitalized twice (both times during finals) for mental health reasons. I got a 3.889, though!

I decided to come back home to online college to finish up my associate's degree I never finished. I retook a class I initially failed (it was during my previous online period) because it was just a hard ass class, but I retook it and got a C. Hardest class I've ever taken and it was a level 200 gen-ed run by a guy who was disappointed his life never went the direction he wanted it to go. Anyways. I also got a good grade in my other class and bumped my GPA up to a 3.208.

Got my associate's degree now, finished last December and decided to take the spring semester off to save money for another school I wanted to transfer to. During the summer and fall of that year, I was hospitalized twice. During the fall and the winter of that year, I ""attempted suicide"" twice (I wasn't faking, I just don't know what else to call it and I don't want to get into details). Making three attempts in total. I was diagnosed with bipolar II after my third attempt (I also got diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD previously, but these didn't affect me as much).

I talk about all of this even though it's really hard for me because I believe it's essential to my story and who I am. I don't know how much I can talk about on college applications, which absolutely sucks. If I go too into detail, I'm seen as a burden and asking for pity. But that's not what I'm doing and I know for a fact I'm not a burden.

Anyways, today I have a combined 3.495 GPA, and I'm transferring to a local university much closer to my dad, that way I have support if something bad happens. But, with medications and being properly diagnosed, my hopes are high. I'm currently going to aim for a 3.9/4.0 (although as long as I have a 3.2+, I'll be okay, as that's the requirement for completion of the honors program). And the reason I'm so positive I might be able to aim this high is because if I can get a 3.5 unmedicated (with bipolar disorder, I need to stress, because that is a BITCH to live with undiagnosed) and unsupported, I think I can get even higher with proper medication and proper support.

I'm now going into marketing (I'm positive I'll stay with my major this time, because I told myself if I don't like it that's too bad), and I'm actually really excited for my classes. So, my first goal is to get a 3.9/4.0 (although I won't beat myself up if I don't get this!), and graduate with a couple internships under my belt. Next, I plan on working for a couple of years (needed for an MBA) while studying for my GMAT (my ideal score is 700+, again, won't beat myself up if I don't get this), and after my MBA and a couple of years with that, I want to get my doctorate and eventually become a professor. I'd also ideally maybe work with nonprofits.

Anyways, now that that spiel is out of the way, let's say these for a couple of examples: I get my ideal GPA of a 3.9, and I get a 730 on my GMAT exam (because I am going to study like a sonofabitch for it), I got good essays (maybe related to my personal experience, maybe not), I explain in my application that I had medical issues preventing me from reaching my full potential. I am also a female coming from an impoverished area, with parents who are both disabled. I am also first-gen, female, and white. I got good extracurriculars under my belt (including working since I was 16), as well as a couple of years (lets say two as the minimum) of relevant work.

I'm fine with getting into a small, nameless school for my MBA (if I choose that as my master's instead of something else). But that's not what I want. I want something that'll impress people. If I get the statistics I previously mentioned, I'll be applying to M7s. I do not expect to get into these M7s, but I'll beat myself up if I don't apply. More realistically, I'll be applying to T25s, preferably the University of Michigan. I'm looking for a fully covered tuition, or at least, half covered.

Be honest and blunt with me, what do I say on my applications, and what are my chances?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1li37jg/please_be_blunt_with_me_do_i_have_a_shot_at/","2025-06-23 00:37:50","CollegeRant","None"
"College has been nothing but pain","First off, I want to say that I'm in community college, so maybe that's why I'm experiencing the issues I‚Äôm about to vent about in this post. I'm a second-year student and will soon transfer to a four-year university. My experience with college has been horrible, and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one because no one else I talk to seems to be having the same experience.

Let‚Äôs start with the classes.

1. The professors suck. They don‚Äôt seem to care about us or the course itself. It feels like they just show up to collect a paycheck. Most of them teach by reading off crappy PowerPoints ‚Äî the kind they could‚Äôve just uploaded online ‚Äî but instead, they waste an hour reading them out loud and call it a day. Then they assign work that‚Äôs almost completely unrelated to the slides. I honestly wish I could get paid thousands of dollars just to read slides. Nice to know where my tuition money is going.


2. The students are assholes. I‚Äôve never met so many rude or fake people in one place. There are basically two types: people who don‚Äôt want anything to do with you, and people who just want to use you ‚Äî either for favors or something else. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone genuine. It‚Äôs also really hard to make new friends. The clubs at my school are worthless, and the people who do go to them are already in tight friend groups. I‚Äôve been to three different clubs ‚Äî big ones, like the gaming club and anime club ‚Äî and the average attendance is like four or five people. So I gave up. At this point, I‚Äôm more isolated than a prisoner.


3. College takes up so much time, and time is money  and I‚Äôm broke. To top it off, I‚Äôm not even sure I want to continue with my major. Thanks to some terrible teachers, I‚Äôve come to hate accounting, which is kind of ironic since it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm studying.



So to recap: the teaching sucks, the social life is nonexistent, and I‚Äôve grown to hate my major. Why am I even doing this?

I‚Äôm halfway through, so now I just feel obligated to keep going. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, because everyone else ‚Äî even people at my school ‚Äî don‚Äôt seem to have these issues. I didn‚Äôt expect college to be perfect, but the fact that I can honestly say I had better education in high school is wild.


TL;DR: The education sucks, the social life really sucks, and college is making me more miserable than I‚Äôve ever been.

"After getting rejected from a program 2 years ago, I'm reapplying and I'm so freaking scared","When I started college, it was a straight up mess. I changed majors every other semester, I kept failing, life was just steam rolling me. When I finally found the one I wanted to do, My GPA was fairly low (2.34 I think). Considering I'm going into healthcare, the school I was at wouldn't consider me and the school I applied to wouldn't either. 

So I applied to another school for something else entirely (still health care but a full bachelors degree) and I got accepted. And though I changed majors to psych at that school because I did what made the most sense for my transcript and my money, I graduated with my B.A.  So now I have two associates and a bachelor's. 

I just finished my application to the one school that had rejected me a few years ago (though it was bought out so it's technically a new school?). This time I'm trying with a resume full of healthcare jobs, 3 degrees, and a letter of recommendation. I still feel like it's not enough bc my GPA is just under 3.0 (2.95 I think) so I'm worried they won't even consider me. This is basically my final gambit. I have a hail mary back-up plan that I don't think will work so I just need this to work out for me. I'm so scared my GPA will be what tanks me.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lh9b8x/after_getting_rejected_from_a_program_2_years_ago/","2025-06-21 23:03:22","CollegeRant","ThrowRAlobotomy666"

"My parents make $0 and seeing other student's parents paying $200k+ for their tuition makes me sad","My parents are both disabled‚Äì the only reason they have a place to live is because our grandma lets us live at her house for almost completely free. But even before they became disabled, my dad was a roofer and my mom was a factory worker, so they weren't making anything spectacular.

My mom did have a small savings before she became disabled ($10k), which was a LOT to us, but she ended up blowing it all on drugs. That's the ""richest"" we've ever been.

I make more than my parents at $14/hr as a food clerk at Meijer. I do have a savings of $8.5k, currently. I am also in a lot of medical debt due to lots of psychiatric hospitalizations (maybe 7 or 8?). I currently have a collection marked as a derogatory on my credit score because I couldn't even afford $10/mo at the time it was given to me. (I completely forgot about this debt, and I have received nothing in the mail about it being in collections... I plan on calling them to see if I can resolve this, but I doubt it).

I went to community college to save money, but it ended up kind of screwing me over, as every university in the state doesn't offer free tuition towards transfer students (except for the University of Michigan, which is not only on the other side of the state, but I got screwed over because the dad I DO NOT LIVE WITH and get NO assistance from technically has assets over $120k, even though he makes $50k/yr). Grand Valley State did offer free tuition for transfers until last year. All these cool programs about free community college were not there when I graduated in 2021.

I have $15k in student loans (I'm in year four of college). Not great, not horrible. I'm saving my money so I'll be able to pay it off.

I'm awaiting to see if I won an $11,000 transfer student scholarship at my university.

Even with the full Pell grant, the full amount of loans, FSEOG grant, and scholarships and grants from the university and from outside scholarships, I still have to pay $5,000 out of pocket (hence why I'm awaiting to see if I won this scholarship). Good news is I'll get tuition reimbursement from Meijer, so this should go back in my pocket.

I just saw a post on r/FAFSA about a student who was a full blown millionare talking about his FAFSA. He proceeded to go into the comments and make insulting comments about poor families, as if it's our choice to be poor. This really hurt.

It also reminds me of the multiple times fellow students will come up to me asking ""what do your parents do?"" and I have to tell them every time that they're disabled and make literally nothing. People act shocked (albeit all of them have been supportive), but it makes me feel so out of place.

And I'm going to be real for a second, I am 100% envious of students who can afford to go to ivy leagues out of pocket and live in luxury apartments because of their parent's pockets. And sometimes seeing these people pisses me off, even when it shouldn't. I know better than to be angry, because it's good to see that somebody is succeeding in the world and has supportive parents, but at the same time, I can't really help it.

But mostly it just makes me feel really sad. I wish I grew up with more money. I wish my mom wasn't a drug addict. I wish my parents weren't disabled (for both their sake and mine). I feel so out of place sometimes.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lgldgx/my_parents_make_0_and_seeing_other_students/","2025-06-21 02:06:02","CollegeRant","None"
"I have screwed myself over","So basically, my high school (a dual enrollment school) required its student to take college classes, at the community college we reside in, while also doing high school classes.

"Living home with my toxic dad","Hello guys. I'm currently a sophomore doing my summer classes. I recently withdrew from an intro to Philosophy course. To get straight to the point, basically I was super overwhelmed from the online class and simply the online class just didn't feel right to me so guys I thought withdrawing the course was good to save my GPA and that's what I did. I withdrew from the course. Fast forward, when I had this conversation with my dad that I withdrew from this course, he literally cursed me out and called me an a-hole for not asking for help and like he was so unhappy and so frustrated. Like I want a nice GPA even if it comes at a hard choice of withdrawing an online summer course like that. Withdrawing courses is not easy but I had to do it to save my GPA. Sorry if I sound like a neurotic kid but my GPA is 3.47 right now cumulative. I'm a chemistry major. A couple of things I didn't find right was that online courses are generally not suitable to me and the pace felt a bit too quick. I'm more of a slow learner when it comes to philosophy. I was simply overwhelmed with work guys. 

He cursed me out and made me feel so bad about myself, like yes dad I'm trying hard but sometimes I'm too overwhelmed to ask for help. HE LITERALLY SAID I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'M (MOSTLY) GETTING As and Bs IN MY OTHER COURSES!!! I EVEN TOLD HIM THAT BUT HE DISMISSED MY EFFORTS. For context, he pays the tuition of my university so he kind of has a right to intervene and ask me. That also pushes me to the halfway point always, should I move out and actually live my life I want in a college out of town but have to deal with not-so-healthy college foods and have to eat out at Chipotle or something to satisfy my hunger. I don't know man, he has been like this since when I was a young kid. But no hate to my dad, I love my dad so much and I will continue to love him but at the same time, man you gotta acknowledge my efforts. Anyway guys, what can I do in this situation guys? I am typing this at night so I may not be able to reply to you instantly but I might reply in the morning. 

  
TL;DR: My dad called me an a-hole and cursed me out and didn't acknowledge my mental health at all, I even communicated my efforts and yeah sometimes I got overwhelmed. I even communicated my efforts but he dismissed those efforts and even threatened me that if I continue down this road, expect me to call you (aka me) an even worse curse word.

"I ruined my GPA in a span of six weeks","I can't believe it. I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I was one of the few people whose marks actually went up from high school to uni. I decided to (stupidly) take two accelerated, online, six-week summer courses that spanned from early May to about now. I knew I was burnt out by the end of April, but the only reason I took those courses was to not be viewed as ""an unproductive loser"" (because I didn't apply to a summer job, and I was discouraged to as well, by my parents) by my household. I think I failed both courses.

I don't know what happened to me. I felt so unmotivated and procrastinated a lot during them. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought of doing a withdrawal from both but I didn't, because I thought I could push through. Now it's a stain on my transcript forever. I think I failed both. One of those courses is related to my major (economics), an intermediate level one, and now I'm discouraged that maybe I should switch majors. Despite me getting A's in the introductory courses and having a genuine passion for the subject. I'm devastated. I think this will only further my depression. I don't even know what I can blame; my laziness or depression. I may not even have depression; I may be unknowingly just using it as an excuse to mask my laziness. My parents are consoling me but I feel ashamed of myself. It's a nightmare.

I have no one to blame by the way. The professors were good, and the tests were fair. I only have myself to blame.

I knew I'd mess up at something. It seemed too good to be true that I had a 3.7 in my first year, given I've had one struggle after another since like 2022 (mainly personal/mental issues). I thought something was finally looking up for my life. But I was wrong. I'm back to square one. When I graudated high school last year and started university I had pledged to myself that I'd do well, and that university would be a ""fresh start"" after the worst 4 years of my life which was high school.

"I was the crazy roommate back in 2023‚Äì it was horribly embarrassing and shameful","MASSIVE trigger warning for suicide.
I don't really know if this is a rant as much as it is ruminating about something terrible. I would talk about it on r/college, but that'd be a guaranteed post being taken down and/or ban. I guess I just need to open up about this.

So I was 20 and I lived with 18 years olds, we met on Facebook and decided to be roommates on-campus for 2023/2024. They seemed really cool.

We got along VERY well (in fact, my roommate had a crush on me, but of course I didn't initiate because I didn't want to date an 18 year old lmfao). We were very close friends.

Well, a couple months in, things started to sour a bit. One of our roommates was irritating everybody else. I had disagreements about how to do the chores (I don't even remember what it was about clearly), and I tried explaining this clearly quite a few times, they just never really got it (or they chose to ignore it).

They did quite a few things that pissed me off, and I do believe that they didn't like me because I disagreed with how to do chores and I was open about it. They were very messy roommates (got warned for their messiness right before I left, left shitty underwear on the counter, garbage everywhere, dirty dishes, used period pads in the shower...) and that irritated me. They expected me to pick up after them, basically.

They started being more and more cold to me as time went on. We started to dislike each other, two of my roommates started to gang up against me and my other roommate.

I'm very stressed out about my grades around this time, and I never told anybody, but I was deeply struggling with suicidal thoughts. When my roommates were gone, I would scream and curse to myself because of how stressed out I was (I was losing it, yes). My roommate did find a suicide note I left at one point, to which I just kind of... apologized to the best of my abilities, and I told her I was okay. She was actually pretty kind about it. She invited me to have tea and talk about fun stuff with her.

I was going crazy by this point. My thoughts made no sense and were very jumbled. I was barely stable in classes, but I did resemble a bit of sanity to the point people outside of my roommates thought I was normal.

I told my residence hall director what was going on. I was afraid to talk to my RA because I knew they'd want to have a group chat with my roommates, and I was afraid to confront them and be singled out even more. He just kind of sighed, made a little comment about not going to the RA, and he didn't really do much. He didn't take me seriously at all, obviously.

Time passes, and we eventually get into a big argument in the group chat. I don't remember about what other than chores and me feeling ganged up on. I was slamming doors and kicking stuff. Eventually, my roommate awkwardly comes into the bedroom and ignores me, and I guess I just kind of snapped. I muttered ""I can't do this anymore"" and grabbed all of my medication and went into the bathroom.

By this point, I took my phone and I called 988, because a small part of me recognized that I was not okay and I needed help. I ended up screaming and sobbing. I was minutes away from downing every pill I had and drinking a combination of all the chemicals I had around me. Fortunately, 988 called the police on me, and so did my roommates, because I think they suspected that something was deeply wrong. A roommate did knock on the door and ask if I was okay, to which I replied yes (I wasn't).

Of course, the police show up along with the person working at the front desk at the time, and I'm taken away to a cop car to the hospital where I was involuntarily admitted for about a week.

By this point, I thought I just had major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. I did have a suicide attempt about a year or two before this.

A week passes and I'm taken back to campus right as finals were about to happen. Great news, my residence hall director emailed me telling me there was an opening in the building, and there was another person seeking out a roommate because of their bad roommate situation. I did have to spend another night at my old dorm, and it was a little awkward, but it was calm. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about it.

Eventually, I did move out. It was awkward and silent between my roommates as I was packing up. My roommate did offer to help me pack very kindly. I refused the help, but I did thank her. And then I moved three floors down.

My new roommate was awesome. We did have a ""disagreement"" on how to do chores, in the sense that we had different ideas of what to do, but we came up with a scenario that worked for both of us very quickly and easily, they were very understanding and nice. We got along just fine for the rest of the year.

I did run into my roommates twice. One time, we ran into each other while I was leaving the dining hall. We smiled at each other and I opened the door for her, and she said thank you. Another time, my roommate left my stuff in a bag by my door that I forgot to pack with a note that said ""Have a great summer :)"", I emailed her thanking her and telling her to have a great summer back. And that was the last we heard from each other.

After this, I transferred back to my community college (partially out of embarrassment) and lived at home while I got my associate's degree (which I earned last December, and then I took the winter semester off). I attempted suicide two more times, and went to the hospital involuntarily three more times.

So, um... yeah, I was the crazy roommate. And I feel just horrible. I mean, really, really bad (as I should). I think I traumatized my freshman year roommates. I don't care how mean they were being towards me at the moment, what I did wasn't okay. But I didn't know what else to do. I was losing my mind.

And what breaks my heart even more is that they were so nice to me about it later. I did meet a friend of my roommate after that incident, and she told me that my roommate spoke about the incident and me poorly, but I really deserve that and I'm okay with that. I almost wish they weren't nice to me about it at all. I think they understood that I wasn't quite all there.

I think the only reason I wasn't academically dismissed is because I did tell my RHD I was struggling a couple of times, and my dad called the college and explained the situation/my mental health. I did have to talk to the student success center and keep visiting them. Trust me, I wouldn't have gone to college and gotten roommates if I knew my mental health was going to be that bad.

Later on (just about 6 months ago actually), I got diagnosed with bipolar II, not MDD. Which explains (but doesn't excuse) the crazy behavior. I'm finally properly medicated. I'm not even suicidal anymore, and I feel genuinely happy, even with the downsides in my life.

I'm returning to in-person college this fall. I am going to have my own personal bedroom, but three suitemates (couldn't afford a single bedroom), but please don't worry. If something bad happens, I only live 20 minutes away from my dad at this university and can stay with him, and I am much more prepared to tackle things this time due to being properly medicated.

So, um... yeah. I was the crazy roommate. And I hate it so much. I feel so guilty (like I should). I guess I just needed to talk about it and open up about it. I wish I could email my previous roommates and apologize, but I think it's better if I left it alone. Like I said, I guess I just need to open up about it. If you read this far, I appreciate it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfjc5m/i_was_the_crazy_roommate_back_in_2023_it_was/","2025-06-19 19:13:09","CollegeRant","None"
"Halfway done with college since last month and it's been a total shitshow","My college experience has been ruined by my shitty immigrant parents and mental illnesses. I knew the steps I needed to change but I just spiraled due to being scared and depressed and I blame myself for it

Firstly, I hate my parents a lot. My neurodivergence was a huge issue, but they made everything worse. They're Indian immigrant parents too by the way. They ruined the first 20 years of my life. They literally abused me a lot as a kid both physically and emotionally for the dumbest shit ever too, they just put pressure and expectations on me, they literally control and shelter me even at 20 and treat me like a fucking child and restrict me from freedom a normal teenager gets in the USA, and I'm pretty sure they only had my little brother and I so we take care of them when they're old or to see us as an extension of themselves. 

They got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis sometime in second to fourth grade, but didn't tell me until 7th grade just because I was too young. Hiding a diagnosis is one thing, but they constantly made me feel like a failure for those stuff and abused me. They KNEW the fucking reasons why I struggled with academics and social situations, had odd specific interests, struggled with attention span and comprehension, why I had to take special ed, why I had to take ABA therapy, why a doctor forced me on a gluten and dairy free diet in third grade and forced me to take some meds, and still fucking treated me like a failure and a bad kid. And until 11th grade, they absolutely REFUSED to get me a psychiatrist or meds. They don't understand my ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression at all and sometimes even downplay my struggles. 

Like they're overall shitty parents. They force me to adhere to Indian culture when I don't connect with it at all and also force Hinduism and some ridiculous superstitions on me when I am personally not religious and they believe you should blindly follow these stuff no matter what and take them very seriously. 

Both of them are narcissists, but my mom even more so because she has almost every textbook trait of a narcissist, so she is generally worse. 

I hate how they say they ""give us everything we want"" and even say they're more lenient than other parents when all they did was give a few toys and stuff for gaming we want and pay for college and expenses which is the fucking bare minimum. They even brag about the BARE bare minimum like giving birth, raising us, wiping our asses, food, clothes etc. 

They say we're the ones who are seeing them as villains and not communicating our feelings and assuming they'll say no, but it's straight bullshit. 

They don't give a shit about anything I like. In elementary school, I loved lego sets and after 5th grade, they stopped buying them just because that was the only thing I bought and they thought I was too old. Even for my 11th birthday with my OWN allowance and birthday money when I wanted to buy a $120 lego set, they didn't let me for that stupid reason. In high school, I was passionate about gaming and even wanted to go pro or make content, but even on summer break, they only let me play 1.5 hours on weekends. And even now in college they're controlling. Like last year when I picked apartment housing for sophomore year, they fucking made me screen share and made me put reqs as no beef, no drinking, no smoking. Im still forced to follow religion and culture blindly, they force me to go on vacations with them or dumb gatherings with family friends. Like I'm 20 for fucks sake and still treated like 12. 

They have high expectations and think anything below a 3.5 is a bad GPA and they say we're lucky they don't expect 4.0. 

They just use the ""give everything you want"" and ""we pay for college and everything"" lines as leverage to control us and later use it in the future. They literally made us study in breaks and only care about us being successful.

Secondly, I hate myself for having ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression. ADHD and Autism fucking ruined my life since childhood. Like I said, it made me struggle academically and socially, made me mentally immature and behind, and have weird interests.Those weird interests made it hard for me to connect with people my age that since middle school, I withdrew myself completely because people became more judgy. While they were into normal interests like sports, pop culture, and TV shows better for their age group, I was still into shows considered childish and toys and even that way in high school. 

My anxiety and depression started in 6th grade too. I was even delusional until 12th grade just every day wishing for some magic powers, which is stupid I know, but it happened and one of the reasons I ruined my life. I did read that child abuse affects amygdala and hippocampus, which increases risk of anxiety and depression, which is probably why I have those two. 

Because of my parents and mental illnesses, I literally missed out on 20 years of my life and experiences like friends, partying, sports, dating, sex, being popular, having a fake ID etc.. Combine that with my parents pressuring me to get out of comfort zone and shell all the,  making friendships and socializing feel draining, and not assimilating to US culture and teaching us how to be socially successful just made me avoid everything. 

It also doesn't help that everyone these days also says that being shy, having no friends, and not fitting in is okay when that's the reason why most of my generation sucks. 

Fast forward to now where I halfway finished college a month ago and it's been an absolute shitshow. I'm at ASU and ever since I stepped foot in it on day 1, my life became much worse. I was placed with outgoing roommates who love to party. That was when I hated myself for how I was and wanting to be introverted when I kept hiding. Like I remember even one hot girl liked me and I didn't believe it. 

After that semester, I wanted to party but I realized you have to be in a frat to party. I wasn't confident enough to rush and then missed out and said I would do it the first sem of sophomore year. Just being lonely and dwelling on the past so much made me more miserable and spiral more that my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 3.59 and just rot more. 

But I did NOTHING to improve myself and just waited and then it came and I got no bids from the houses I rushed. You'd think I'd improve myself this time, but I fell in a worse spiral and tanked my GPA  to a 3.46 instead, even skipped classes for a whole month, and even had a shitty diet and worked out less. Then 4th sem came and this time same shit. It sucked because I actually tried this time and was more social and cracked jokes and everyone was gassing me up and even in one of the other frats I knew 4 guys from freshman year and 3 of them had exec positions and even acknowledged my change, yet I didn't get in a SINGLE invite only event. It sucks because sophomore year is generally the last time to rush. I know I could've gotten in a bottom house and still can in junior year because they bid anyone, but I hate them because they're like 40 members at most and all rejects who only joined because they were rejected from actual frats just for the sake of being in one, but they're still irrelevant. 

I know most people go to bars instead of frat parties and frat parties are usually off campus, but I really wanted this shit since second semester of college to meet a lot of people quickly and be popular and that's what I based my whole identity on to get in those specific frats. Even though people still tell me I can make a few drinking buddies and a girl and even if people drift after college, it sucks ass at the moment not being in a frat, especially under 21. 

I literally vowed that if i get a bid, I'd start getting my shit together.And it does seem like many people who party are in the frats I just hated everyone in greek life since then and hated people in general. The decent frats are mostly people who have been ready since HIGH SCHOOL. Many of them are even PROUD of being exclusive, but I bet a lot of them never had to deal with neurodivergence or a shitty upbringing. It sucked how they straight up gassed me up and cut me early. I'd rather have been straight up INSULTED and beaten up and thrown out rather than whatever the fuck that was. I hope a day comes where I get to beat these people up because after this rejection from the frats when it was my last chance to rush, I don't have a chance at the most optimal college experience possible.

I don't wanna join a club or just talk to people in classes because clubs are for nerds and nothing like frats. And I DO wanna party which most of these losers online are against. That semester was the worst that I even failed a class and tanked to a 3.29. I hate being told to just make the best out of everything. I was too scared coming from abuse and being sheltered and neurodivergence into college and anxious to talk to people because they wouldn't like me. This frat shit was the only shit I wanted in college and I have no chance anymore. 

My life gets worse every year, but ever since I started college, it's been much worse. I just hate myself for my fucked up mind making me miss out on everything. 

I don't know if I'll ever have a college experience as I hoped. I fucking hate this place and can't wait to graduate. I'm just so bitter and resentful towards the people having what I have and towards the people who excluded me. I hate my parents for not knowing how to be good parents and not assimilating to US culture and learning how to be cool. I hate myself for constantly spiraling and blowing up the last chance at rush. Sure I can get some drinking buddies and a girl and most people go to bars when older, but it won't feel the same as being in a frat.

"If I medically withdrew from college, how likely am I to be accepted at a new one?","
Hello everyone,

I graduated high school in 2017. My parents told me at the time that they would help pay for college *if* I chose a Christian college. I ended up choosing Colorado Christian University and was accepted. I started in their 2017 fall semester. 

For reasons that would take far too much time to explain (suppressed queer identity, *nasty* break-up, etc), I ended up *severely* depressed during just that first semester. So much so that I was skipping classes and even skipping *midterms.* Obviously, my GPA tanked. Professors and advisors reached out to try and help, and I blew them all off with excuses about 'family emergencies, work, blah blah' whatever bullshit excuse I could think of, anything but admit that I was incredibly suicidal. 

A short time later, I was put on Financial Aid Hold, which is was alerted my parents to the situation. I finally told the professors and advisors the truth about my situation, and they pretty unanimously suggested I Medically Withdraw from school. After a few counselling sessions, that is what I did. 

  
Now, here I am, years later, with no degree and wanting to go back to school. I'm worried, however, about my chances of being accepted to a new school with my record. Do any of the aforementioned things impact my likelihood of being accepted, or impact my likelihood of receiving financial aid? If so, is there anything I can do to.... 'fix' it? What are my options?

___


Edit: (unnecessary little vent, entirely irrelevant to the main point of my post ‚Äî just reflecting back):


It‚Äôs really daunting and frustrating to be 26, and finally begin to realize just how much my choices as an 18 year old are still messing with my future today. I have grace and kindness for that 18 year old ‚Äî they were an absolute wreck, confused, lonely, angry, careless. But that 18 year old also pretty royally messed up their own future. I wish I had taken a gap year rather than jump right into college at 18 when I wasn‚Äôt even sure I *wanted* to go to college; I wish I‚Äôd been honest with my professors right when the trouble started, because maybe then there would have been the chance to save my grades. Frankly, I wish I‚Äôd never chosen CCU lol, for a lot of other reasons. 

Because now, it feels as though that angry and sad little teen burned all my bridges. And in this economy, even people *with* degrees are struggling to find work ‚Äî so it probably comes as no surprise that I‚Äôve been out of work for a year now, despite endless applications and attempts at finding *anything.* 

It‚Äôs strange, because 18 year old me definitely didn‚Äôt expect there would ever *be* a 26 year old me. I wasn‚Äôt concerned for my future, because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have one. Now, im in that kid‚Äôs future, wishing I‚Äôd done so many things differently.

"Is finishing college completely at 26 bad?","I'm making this post for advice and to vent but just right now my aunt asked me when I'll be done with school and I said that I'm going to be at community college for 3 years, and transfer to another college for another 4 years most likely. Also, I know it's usually 2 years, but I don't want to pressure myself, so I just extended it for myself and to do take more electives, is that bad too?

I started going to college right after I graduated high school, so I started at 18. I am currently 19 years old. And who knows if I'll continue to go back to school for another art degree but I'm not that far yet.. 

My major is studio art, but I want to change it to either illustration or maybe ceramics. Illustration is the most likely one but still unsure. But is finishing school complete at age 26 as an art major bad? I'm one to overthink such a simple thing and I might be overthinking this soon.

"Funnily enough, looking back I don't remember all the classes I've failed","So in highschool I was an -A student with a few Bs here and there. My GPA was approx 3.75 and I loved school. Fast forward to my first college which was a local community college. My grades dipped, they ignored my disability accomodations, I struggled with online, I struggled with the lack of friends and lack of sense of belonging as it was a commuter school. So I tanked everything and went down to a GPA of 2.34. 

Eventually, I decided they weren't worth my time and transferred to a local university. Still commuting for the sake of money but a bachelor's degree was on the horizon. All of a sudden I had accomodations, success coaches, professors who \*didn't\* encourage me to give up (quite the opposite actually), and I made a few more friends here and there. This school even helped me get the *2 whole associates degrees*  I earned at the community college that they didn't tell me about. Since I transferred so many credits My bachelors degree is technially made up of only 50-ish and my GPA is 2.95 with the semesters usually being around 2.9-3.3. 

Currently I'm applying for a certificate school now that I'm done with my bachelors. Realizing my GPA is still a little low, I went through my transcript and realized I failed 8 classes at community college. *8 whole classes!* Not once was I advised to retake them, actually I was once just told to leave the major entirely. But something about that just makes me feel a little better knowing that a whole new environment gave me the boost I needed. Sure, 2.95 isn't great or ideal, but coming up from 1.97 or 2.34 in 2 years, that's not bad and I hope my next school can see the improvement once I changed schools. That Academically I was able to do better once I was I was in a place where I felt supported and the school actually cared about its students. Hopefully they see the growth and not just the final number","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l9b2f3/funnily_enough_looking_back_i_dont_remember_all/","2025-06-12 02:20:10","CollegeRant","ThrowRAlobotomy666"
"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here. I just feel like a loser. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l8w54k/i_think_i_need_help/","2025-06-11 15:48:54","CollegeRant","temporaryboi_"
"Update to Metadata Saga>","Just wanted to share a quick and honestly kind of hilarious update to my previous rant about my school accusing students of academic dishonesty based on document metadata, shared templates, and even bold text. The most ironic part is that all of this happened in a Social and Legal Relationships in Forensic Science class. A class literally about how evidence and legal systems work was punishing students for things like metadata they didn‚Äôt understand, formatting choices, and templates given by the instructor. They were teaching us about due process, burden of proof, chain of custody, and fairness in criminal investigations while simultaneously saying that having two authors listed in a Word document was probably cheating. The standard of evidence they used was ridiculously low basically if something ‚Äúlooked suspicious,‚Äù that was enough to accuse students, and the burden was on the students to prove their innocence. If it wasn‚Äôt so damaging to students, it would be comedy. They kept insisting the process was educational and not punitive, yet students were flagged, questioned, stressed out, and sometimes penalized for normal things like bolding subheadings or using the provided file. The hypocrisy was wild.  It was lower then even a civil court case. Now that I‚Äôm officially an alum, I can fully say I survived the academic integrity circus and the irony that came with it. Thanks for all the support and validation on the last post .You all made me feel way less crazy.

 **TL;DR** The cheating accusations over metadata, templates, and formatting all came from a forensic science class about law and evidence. They used a ridiculously low standard of proof basically just ‚Äúlooks suspicious‚Äù was enough to accuse students, and it was up to the students to prove they didn‚Äôt cheat. I‚Äôm finally an alum and so glad to be done with that nonsense.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l79umx/update_to_metadata_saga/","2025-06-09 16:50:03","CollegeRant","Lumpy-Draft2822"

i plan on majoring in film and minoring in marketing. two of my teachers have already written recommendation letters for me, and i will have to apply with my IB predicted grades.

I want to write my essay on how art and visuals have helped me connect with myself and my mother, who passed some years ago (when i was 14)- how film has accompanied me through grief, joy, love, sadness, etc. i want to talk about how i found my father did, in fact, exists, how i live with grief, acceptance, and growth. i am still not sure about the topic, because i want my essay to be REALLY good and maybe up my chances on going to a more prestigious uni. in uruguay, most students stay here or go to argentina- so its hard to find proper help. i live un punta del este, and almost all essay tutors are in montevideo, and whilst it's not an incredibly long ride (about 2 hours max), with my IBs and everything inbetween there's barely if not any time for me to take these courses.

"Don't Get It.","I just don't get why it matters so much to kids where they go for their undergrad and the ""prestige of it"". Everyone acts as though getting Harvard to take away 380K from your parents will set you up for life, but that point is undeniably not true in any regard. Everyone here wants success, I understand that, but what is success for you? Is success the amount of influence you can get in real life? (after college) And/or is it the amount of money you have in your bank account?  Neither of which college can give you a straight path to do so, if you want to make millions. **As long as a college teaches you your selected skill at a sufficient level to implement it, that's it. Your state college will teach you the same thing as an ivy will at half the cost.** Everyone's so down the crab in a barrel mentality that the only way to be successful is get into a good college, and sorry to burst peoples bubbles but **getting into an ivy doesn't mean shit, it's what you make of it that does,** nobody cares what college you went to 10-15 years from now, it'll be a good conversation starter, but if you're barely cracking 100 after paying that much for an education you'll just look like an idiot, and your education isn't gonna protect you from that.

You need to develop a vision in your life and a goal, ""I see myself with my feet up on a yacht making millions"" isn't a goal or a vision that will get you somewhere, you need to have an obsession with your field and the ability to take a risk fast enough to capitalize on a market when the time is right.

"Need suggestions for reference...(might take some time)","As an immigrant from China, I came to Hawaii last summer. My public school let me continue to take 11th grade instead of repeating my 10th grade since my credits were enough. At that time, I didn't realize the seriousness.

Back in China, I was a high school freshman in the best high school in my city, where I took the standard test called ""zhongkao"" to get into. I kept my resilience in high school, keeping my grades ranking in 100-200 among \~1000‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ until the second semester of my 10th grade, my mom told me the request that my dad had applied for sending us to gather was approved.

I thought that was a great opportunity to get rid of the ""competitiveness"" and ""intensity"" of China's education system and also a chance to develop my global values. 

Unfortunately, I was placed in lower-level classes with EL support, some of which are for 9th graders, because my counselor helped with my schedule to catch up so-called ""credits"". I thought naively American high school was so easy and chill that I enjoyed my whole year participating sports(wrestling, judo) and scrolling my phone. 

I feel like I'm the way behind when I realized my high school offered 16 APs and tons of Dual Credits‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and I took none. I wasted my whole year doing which is the most important year in high school‚Ä¶ Looking back, I regret not taking action earlier, even though I did hear many ‚Äúclues"". Bur I was spun around in circles by counselors and ChatGPT. One says ""you don't need those""; another one encourages ""you've been doing great"" but actually ‚ÄúSpiritual Victory Method‚Äù which is self-deception.

So far: I plan to take AP Calc next year so I took PreCalc/Trig during summer for advancing(which our counselor not recommanded) and rn I think PreCalc are not hard especially compared to what I learned in China, but I wasted my junior year taking down-dimensional Algebra 2. I also plan to take AP Chinese, AP Physics 1, and AP Chemistry(if possible). I hope I can register for dual credit next spring successfully. I know clearly that taking those classes doesn't boost my competitiveness since admissioner can't see my weighted GPA at that time before my full transcript, but¬†I really hope to give it a try before I graduate. 

I took SAT in June which was 1430(Math790 R&W640) so that I need to take it again this October. ACT was conducted in my school, and I only scored 25 even with accommodation(1.5times standard time).

I am part of Test Club and would be VP next year. I'm a Dialogue Club co-president and a math tutor in Schoolhouse world. I'm in Science Club, earning Tower Event C Bronze Medal at Regionals and Forensics Event Bronze Medal at State Medalists. I participated AMC 12 last year but only got 66‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I joined Non-Trivial Research Foundation Program Spring Cohort this year but didn't accepted into Fellowships. Right now I'm self-learning python (but struggling).

I had a conversation with our college counselors already. They were pity to tell me I'm not competitive enough as other students. I was a little crashing out at that time and couldn't(right now either) accept my fate of going into the only state college and even community colleges. It looks the best fit for me when I think about this. But what I really worry about is whether it is limited by human/system arrangement, or this is just my level. I'm not really know how is my potential at and how much I can get to. Although I've been stay here for the entire year, I always still feel lost my direction. People around me are walking on different paths like so-called ""diversity"" then I don't know which is valuable information. I think the hardest part for me is not only at cultural shock and language barrier but the huge information gap between me and other great peers who I don't know about due to EL classes arrangement and my own satisfaction. 

Other: My dream major is chemistry so far because since I took competition course in China during high school, I've hoped to learn deeper chemistry in college. But when it comes to the career path in post-college, I am always stuck, which makes me more disoriented.

for example, i'm interested in mostly LACs and really want to apply to schools where i think the culture would be a good college experience. i'm also an asian F, so i am interested in many of the high achieving schools... it's so hard to decipher what is a decidiing factor or not between all the schools!

"Disappointed in myself and stuck. How to move forward?","I'm currently in my Work-Integrated Learning term of my program. So far, I thought we have been doing good as a group and have been told that we've been working hard, until recently. 

In the beginning we were given training/demo videos of about 25+ hours worth of time of coding to prep us for our actual work. There was instructions that we will be graded eventually, at first I was on top of everything, but got too comfortable when weeks have passed and we didn't get checked for those coding repository. I at first followed with coding, but eventually just watched and took notes of the videos since it might take me too long and some extra work came early to us.

Well, my instructor checked mine and I barely had something to show and it did not got well. I was told I would already be considered a fail since we had a minimum grade for the term and the training were a chunk of that. He still gave me extension and I admit to that mistake on my part. Also, it was the same for my other group members and I'm pretty sure other groups as well, however, their work won't be graded until next week.

I've never been in this kind of situation before, so everything was very heavy on my mental health. I really thought we were doing good, but turns out we didn't ""look"" to be taking our work seriously and was only doing an ""okay"" job.

Just to give some context, while a few of my groupmates have been late almost every day, and some haven‚Äôt been putting in much effort, I‚Äôve been doing my best to stay on track and do our work.

But I‚Äôm still a bit confused about where exactly we‚Äôve fallen short aside from the missed training, of course. In our activities, he would say to take our time, or no pressure, and that we've been working hard.

"Engineering majors who struggled with math: How did you rebuild your foundation and start enjoying it?","Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm currently in my second semester of university as a Computer Science major, and I‚Äôve failed both the preschool/basic math and physics course and the main math course in these two semesters.

Back in high school, I was a science major, but honestly, I never really understood math well I was just trying to pass. Now in college, it‚Äôs catching up with me hard. I struggle even with the basics like algebra and functions, and because of that, I‚Äôve developed a real frustration and even hate toward math. Every time I try to study, I just feel dumb and discouraged.

But I know that math is essential in CS, and I don‚Äôt want this to ruin my degree or career path. So for those of you who were in a similar situation:

How did you actually start learning math from the ground up in college?

What topics should I start with to rebuild my basics?

Any resources (YouTube channels, courses, books, etc.) that made math click for you?

How did you change your mindset to not hate math and maybe even enjoy it?


Right now I feel like I‚Äôm at zero and falling behind. I‚Äôm willing to put in the work, but I need a roadmap and some hope that it‚Äôs not too late.

"Should I withdraw now or wait it out?","Hey! I need some advice. I'm about to go into my 5th and final year of my degree, and I'm taking two courses right now. One is a 6-week spring course for my major, and the other is a 13-week statistics course that is just an elective. I did not have the high school prerequisite for this stats course, but took it anyway on advice from other students. My school doesn't have the type of advisors who give the best advice about this stuff, so I never ended up getting a professional opinion. 

As of right now, I'm not failing this stats course, but it's really draining to do the online assignments, and I'm not sure how I'll pass my midterm in June. I have cried every time I've sat down to do an assignment. It's just so hard, and I don't have the background for it. Part of me wants to withdraw now so that I can focus on work (job is in my field and flexible) and the other class, while part of me wonders if I should try to work hard and turn it around. 

Part of what makes me anxious is that my first year was BAD. I took 6 classes and got 2 Ds, 1 F, and 3 Ws. That can be explained away on grad school apps, but I'm concerned that taking a 4th W so late in the game is really going to hurt me. I just made Dean's List this year, so I almost feel like I improved tremendously just to drop the ball again.

Don't worry, I know that a W is better than an F or even a D or C, and I won't let that happen, but I am concerned that pouring 2 more months into a class just to withdraw will make me feel like I wasted my time being miserable, while withdrawing now will make me feel guilty and like I wasted an opportunity to grow. I would really appreciate some advice or words of wisdom. My graduation timeline, money, etc. are not part of my considerations. It's pretty much just that I feel like crap about this situation and wish I could go back in time and drop this class before the drop deadline. I have a feeling that I'm being silly though and just need some clarity from an outsider.

"Scared","Im an Incoming freshman majoring in pre-med chemistry, and Im very scared about the rigor of my classes. 

I'm coming out of high school with an associates degree through a local community college. Because of this, I have all of my basics done, and looking at my degree audits for chemistry Im worried it'll be too much.

To finish out my degree I need to take (along with a a handful of other courses);

Gen Chem
O Chem
IO Chem
P Chem
Bio Chem
Calc 3
Diff Eqs
Stats
Phys

I understand that classes get progressively harder, what Im most concerned about is the sheer VOLUME of classes that I'll have to take at once. All of my electives/cores are done for the most part, and it feels like Ill be taking multiple incredibly difficult classes at once, which frankly scares the hell out of me.

Im worried that Ill preform poorly because of it. Im worried that my freshman year of college will get the fun drained out of it by the workload of 8+ chemistry/math courses.

Overall I just have a lot of anxiety heading into college (unique ik), and I feel like Ive dealt myself a bad hand getting all of my easy classes out of the way, meaning I have nothing to fill in the gaps around the hard ones.

Are these fears unfounded? I guess Im looking for advice on how to handle it, or even if it's something I should be worrying about. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

"I feel like a failure","i go to a very, very small school. a little over half of the students in the graduating class are in NHS. i feel so stupid because i'm not in it. i begged them to put me in honors classes this year (its confusing at my school, you either take all honors or no honors) because i knew i could do it and they said that it was full (only 9 students are allowed in honors/every class). 

i graduated yesterday with a 3.4 and i dont feel any better about it. i shouldve just repeated a year.

freshman year i wasnt at that school and was at public school where i was struggling. i was put into the psych ward twice that year and only had an hour of time to do schoolwork a week. when i got back, they locked me in a small room to do the missing work, effectively causing me to miss more work. freshman year brought down my gpa dramatically, making me unable to get into nhs despite having all A's in 10-12th grade. 

this doesnt mean anything though ‚Äî my school is a therapeutic school. everyone is weird and has their own struggles, many probably worse than mine, and they still have managed to surpass what i have done.

throughout elementary and most of middle school i was an exemplary student. my grades were my only way to have any self esteem because i didnt have any in other areas, largely in part because of undiagnosed autism, depression, and body dysmorphia. i now have nothing to like myself for.

im at a point where im considering killing myself. im going to a college with 70% acceptance and i keep seeing people on social media getting into much better schools. its worse because i know if i was in a better mental state i could've been them. i know im smart enough to have made it to the same heights they have, but i ruined it for myself and there is no way to redo it.

i dont know what to do. people keep telling me i can just do well in college to make up for how i was in high school but im afraid im going to lose motivation and fail out of college. because my school is small there were no comp sci classes so i have no experience in my major at all. 

i dont see any other future for me besides ending it now.
