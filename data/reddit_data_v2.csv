"Anyone else thinking of leaving bc of the Big Beautiful Bill? (among other things)","I (24F) am from an immigrant household, and I am the first member of my family born in the US. Everyone in my nuclear family is a citizen either by birth or naturalization but essentially all of our extended family lives scattered through West Africa.
I feel like I could build a better life and future for myself in Africa sometimes. My family is on the low income/working class side here but we are solidly middle class and upwardly mobile over there accruing generational wealth. I work and live paycheck to paycheck and I am burning out because I don‚Äôt feel confident about my future here, especially with this ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äùmaking its way through Congress. 
If I were to move, there would be a place for me to stay, avenues for me to maybe even get my own apartment, find a job, etc with my family‚Äôs support. 

I have a US bachelors degree and lots of skills but I‚Äôm worried about this huge of a leap. I‚Äôm not so close to my extended family and I don‚Äôt speak the indigenous language in our country (but I speak French fluently.) 

Also concerned because I am LGBT lol,,,, I just don‚Äôt think that I am likely to find long term companionship in the country where I would be moving. That‚Äôs the one thing that‚Äôs holding me back, but the way the US is going, there are so many more things that are pushing me away.

I have no loyalty to this country, is the thing. I am a 2024 college grad with no debt, no kids, no long term fiscal responsibilities outside of myself.

"What do you think is the biggest difference between Gen Z and Millennials?","As a Millennial myself I've always seen the two generations as being very similar from a pop culture perspective with the main divider being 9/11, As an 89er Millennial I can only really anecdote from my own perspective and age group. But what the 90s were while living in North America, were peace, prosperity, a gargantuan number of new franchises and lines of toys including video games, board games, card games, and more general electronics like cd players, vcrs, stereos, cds, and a shit tonne of kids movies including disney's white boxed vault movies.

The 90s are a long since past but deeply remembered decade where I just felt safe, innocent, perhaps even ignorant. Not JUST because I was a kid, but because we weren't online all the time and the internet we had back then was barely the internet at all.

What I think I'll say on that note then is that, Millennials are a generation of nostalgia because we actually had a decade of awesome things to be nostalgic about, but Gen Z is a generation that started in a depressed and rotten civilization from the start. They don't fundamentally understand the loss we suffered. In March 2001 my grandparents were able to wait with me while I, an 11 year old and unaccompanied minor waited for my flight from Florida back to Canada. That doesn't happen anymore.

Gen Z were playing as kids what Millennials were playing as teens. In the context of 9/11, that meant war propaganda games like call of duty, halo, time splitters, mass effect, command and conquer, star craft, battlefield, and to some extent grand theft autos as well. Gen Z grew up faster. Because Millennials grew up in a world that catered to kids but Gen Z grew up in a world that catered to adults and wanted you to grow up. This process was sped up by Covid and by the generally more adult pop culture that continues to be cranked out.

That's just me thinking out loud. Thanks for reading.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lpi0zq/what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_difference/","2025-07-02 00:25:44","GenZ","Straight-Sink-9334"

I‚Äôm really struggling right now, ever since November last year I‚Äôve been unable to get involved or excited by my classes. I feel helpless. 

I‚Äôve had to post pone tests, and once I walked out of a test before it finished because I was so overwhelmed. I had to drop a class for the first time after trying so hard.

My planner is empty, my room is a mess. It‚Äôs community college, i was taking calc 2. I didn‚Äôt even show up. I know why. I lost insurance this year, just overall unfortunate. But I thought I was stronger than my ailments. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should cut my workload, I only have 2 IGETC left and these are my last core classes. I have two classes to retake. Everyone tells me I‚Äôm doing great, I just don‚Äôt believe it. My body is falling apart and I feel like my brain is a close second.

"Appealing - school denied my final semester","Hi everyone  
  
I‚Äôm writing this post because I recently received news that my school won‚Äôt let me proceed to my final semester, and I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm appealing the decision but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll work, and I‚Äôd really appreciate advice or support.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I had to undergo two major surgeries for medical reasons at the start of my 6th semester (7 semesters in total).
* I‚Äôve been living alone since both of my parents passed away in 2023. When I began school in 2022, they were alive and I lived with them, so I had financial stability (I was 24 at the time).
* After their death, I‚Äôve been managing everything alone: paying rent, working 80% (4 days/week) just to survive while doing 2.5 days of school and studying weekends for almost weekly exams, doing my assignments etc.
* I‚Äôm also undergoing HRT since 2022, which has been medically necessary for me.
* Despite being under extreme stress and depression, I still passed most subjects. I was only half a grade (!!!) short of making it through.
* I had repeated a year before due to the emotional toll (HRT and parents), but I bounced back.
* The school was cold and inflexible about my situation, even when my surgeon had to step in to confirm the surgeries‚Äô importance. They didn't want to let me get my surgeries basically and I had to fight for it.
* I feel this is deeply unfair since I‚Äôm six months away from graduating and I‚Äôve fought through things most people thankfully never have to.

I‚Äôm appealing the decision, attaching documentation like the surgery confirmation, death certificates (perhaps optional since they're confidential to me), employment records, mail exchanges with my doctors, and more.

Any advice on how to word this better, or similar experiences? Do you think I can receive empathy to my situation?

**TL;DR:**  
School denied my final semester. I lost both parents, live alone, work 80%, had surgeries, and fought through depression + financial hardship. Missed passing by half a grade.

"Should I drop out of university because of mental health? Advice needed.","Hi, Sorry if this is long! I‚Äôd greatly appreciate if you took the tiime to read it.

I‚Äôm heading into my final year of uni after taking a mental health break, and I‚Äôm seriously considering dropping out.

I took a year off after a rough period‚Äîmy mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.

For context, i‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I‚Äôve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.

Since January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven‚Äôt been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîmeds, structured routines, new environments‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt focus or motivate myself. It‚Äôs like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.

Now I‚Äôm questioning everything. I don‚Äôt enjoy my course and can‚Äôt picture myself in a 9‚Äì5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing‚Äîespecially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I‚Äôm terrified this would confirm it.

I want to get better, but I don‚Äôt know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.

"I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind this upcoming semester","I (F21) just attended orientation for my university. I'm moving hours away from home to a city I‚Äôve visited a grand total of one time.

I'm a psych major who wants to go to grad school. I'm also the obnoxious student who's in 10 different clubs. Last year, while I was still in community college, I balanced Student Media, occasional student government meetings, PTK, helping to organize campus events, and SkillsUSA‚Äîall while taking classes, applying to multiple universities for transfer, and working on campus, sometimes up to 20 hours per week.

I blame this on my ADHD, really, because my brain goes, ""HEY, I WANNA DO THAT THING!

So I do the thing... kinda, sorta. I usually procrastinate, barely hold everything together, and break down every so often. But I do get it done, so yay?

So, as I'm leaving for university, I'm unfortunately taking my neuroticism with me. But I'm also severely burnt out. I have been for a while, really.

And yet, I‚Äôm actually really excited for school‚Äîmeeting new people, learning new things, research, all that fun stuff. I have a really weird love-hate relationship with academia.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôve already started stressing out, as orientation has been a huge information overload. Do I apply for internships right now? A job? Volunteer work? Organizations? What‚Äôs the appropriate level of proactiveness? Why am I the only loser attending any of the optional sessions?

Anyway, I'm seeing a therapist on Wednesday, but I‚Äôd love to hear any advice from people who‚Äôve been in university longer‚Äîpreferably if you‚Äôre anything like me (I‚Äôll pray for you)‚Äîon how you manage your schedule between class and extracurricular activities.

"I‚Äôm switching paths‚Äîneed help choosing a major.","Hi all, I‚Äôm currently studying in Italy in a bachelor‚Äôs program called *‚ÄúSocial Innovation, Communication, and New Technologies‚Äù*. It‚Äôs an interdisciplinary degree mixing computer science, design, and social sciences. I originally picked it with the goal of becoming a UX designer or digital marketer‚Äîsomething job-ready and practical.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve realised I don‚Äôt want to work in tech or design anymore. What I really care about is **academia**, **research**, and working in institutions like the **EU**, **UN**, **NGOs**, or **think tanks**. I want to do a **master‚Äôs (probably abroad)**, then hopefully a **PhD**. Ideally I‚Äôd like to end up in Belgium, the Netherlands, or maybe stay in Italy.

Right now, I‚Äôm torn about what to do. My current degree feels too applied, and I‚Äôm seriously considering switching to something like:

* **Sociology**
* **Economics**
* or even **History** (though it feels a bit abstract and less ‚Äúmarketable‚Äù)

"Feeling directionless and lost as a senior, need advice","I'm 21 and after this summer I will be going into my senior year of college. I'm a double major, currently pursuing studio art and statistics, and plan to go to grad school for statistics. My issue is less that I don't have any job prospects (even though I don't), and more that I actually have no idea what I want to do for my future. I'm incredibly behind in my statistics degree, but on top of that I don't even think I want to work a stats job for the rest of my life. My main passion is video game concept art but I doubt my ability to succeed in that industry because I know so many talented artists with more internships under their belts and better portfolios, but the thought of doing stats for the rest of my life feels like a drag. I am currently working on looking for a job as a caricature artist, but even with caricature work I'm worried people would look down on me for it since it's not really considered a high skill job, even though I really enjoy doing it and have made some good money off of it in the past. I also doubt my ability to get a job as a statistician. Overall, I feel behind my peers in so many ways, feel lost and directionless for my future, and it's too late to change my major so I just have to graduate.

"I feel like a loser for taking more time to graduate","Trigger warning (in case): Depression   
  
  
TLDR: I failed my first attempt at my bachelors thesis and I am depressed and ridden with guilt and fear of breaking the news to my parents.   
  
Hi everyone, I (22F) started college September 2021 for my bachelors degree in International Business. Currently I am in my fourth and final year and we have to do a thesis and a defense as our final projects with an external company. Unforunately, I got the news recently that I failed my recent attempt at my thesis report so therefore, I won't qualify for a defense, and will have to attend a feedback session next week to get information on how to improve on my next submission which will be in September. Sure, it is only 2 months and that's hardly a delay but I still feel like a loser as people around me of course are passing one by one and are graduating in July which was supposed to be me but not now. 

For more context, the way it works at my uni is to do an internship in my first semester of my fourth year and then a thesis project with preferably the same company or different. Luckily, I was able to get an extension with the company that I was already with as they liked my work and the team also liked me.  
  
This entire process was super difficult as I was working as an intern still at that company 32 hours a week, I also had to attend some classes for uni in between, I was also taking language lessons in between as I was also planning to get a permanent residence card of the country where I am currently located in as I have lived there long enough and are eligible.   
  
I realized too late that I was burning out rapidly and I already struggle with depression and anxiety and my home life isn't great either as I still live with my parents. I honestly dropped the ball during the process. I take full accountability, but it still hurts. I have let down myself, my parents and some lecturers who really believed in me and my potential. I still need to break the news to my parents as well but I am so scared and my mental health has deteriorated so much in the past months that I am also in therapy now with the emergency hotline. 

I do want to graduate. I‚Äôve already been accepted into a pre-master‚Äôs program I wanted but I have to postpone that now to the next academic year and also my parents who pay for my tuition have to pay for an extra 2 months and I just feel so guilty.

"I don‚Äôt know what to do and need some advice","Hello sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors I‚Äôm typing this super late from where I‚Äôm at but I need some advice. I‚Äôm a rising senior and switched my major from computer science to data science, although they are similar data science at my school has a lot more courses. I‚Äôm also a dual major but I‚Äôm finishing that major up quickly. I planned on taking 3 more semesters so I could graduate a semester later. However I got super tired and depressed and couldn‚Äôt really take any of my classes that semester and withdrew from 2 courses. My biggest fear is that was going to happen again as that semester was super light and I still ended up dropping classes. I planned on taking summer classes so I could catch up. 1 of the courses which I just finished was just a fun class nothing related to my major and taking a calculus 3 course which isn‚Äôt going terribly. However I haven‚Äôt had a break from classes since my freshman year summer . I found out I start my second semester today technically and I broke down crying unsure if I can even make it through. The break I had was 3 days in between the semester and those were technically exam days.The class doesn‚Äôt have the best rating however if I don‚Äôt take it this semester I will have to take it this fall with 2 more difficult courses. Either way if I do decide to drop I will overthink and stress about the following semester and repeat my mistakes. Other than that the financial aid aspect is worrying me but I think I can handle that if I do decide to drop. However what really worries me is my mother. She doesn‚Äôt mind how long I take on my degree but doesn‚Äôt like me dropping classes. I don‚Äôt really understand but dropping those classes this winter made her kind of disappointed and I‚Äôm already not in a place where I can handle that. However cause of my decisions taking classes this summer, withdrawing those classes was kind of useless. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I just want to graduate and be over with school but I don‚Äôt have much experience with jobs, internships, or clubs. It is kind of hard since I commute to school and can‚Äôt really attend late events and even if I could I‚Äôm just always so tired. My other major doesn‚Äôt really have any job prospect without doing an additional degree. My school is extremely rigorous and if I don‚Äôt put any effort failing is an option ,since 70% of the course is graded on just exams and there are 2 exams. What even more insane is that this course has a higher rated professor this summer than the fall but when one is rated 2.9 and the other 2.3 are the prospect really great. The class is not transferable and required so I will have to suffer through it to graduate.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1llodun/i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_need_some_advice/","2025-06-27 08:07:26","college","Tiredcat640"
"Failing a modern language course class during Summer and need some advice.","Just for a little bit of background, I'm a senior undergraduate in Sociology with 129 credits as of right now with a 3.43 GPA which is decent but could be a whole lot better. I need at least 2 or 3 more semesters before I'm fully done. However I was taking a fast paced 4 week ASL 101 course that ended up being too much for me to handle. I missed the deadline to drop by one day so the options of withdrawal are out of the window
 A similar situation happened back in Summer 2023 when I was majoring in Informatics at the time and ended up failing one class and withdrawing from the other.  I rebounded ever since I switched my major to Sociology during that time. However, this time around I'm aware that my GPA will take a hit but not sure how badly it will be. I don't have any passion in ASL and would like to look into other modern language options. Any type of advice would be very much welcomed.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1llhac8/failing_a_modern_language_course_class_during/","2025-06-27 01:18:49","college","Warriors1234"
"Too young for the college experience","I‚Äôm 19f. I started college at 16. I was born in the U.S. but raised abroad and returned here alone for school. My first year was rough adjusting to a new country, but sophomore year got better. I made some friends and started enjoying myself more.

Then junior year hit. I took on leadership roles, 18 credits a semester, and stopped going out as much. I got into a relationship but still made an effort to show up for my friends. As everyone turned 21, I slowly got left out. My hangout invites were ignored and people avoided certain conversations around me. I felt out of place, so I pulled back.

I also took a break from social media to focus on school. When the year ended, I realized I was burnt out and felt really alone. No one checked on me unless I reached out first.

My living situation made things worse. I signed a lease with random roommates. One was introverted, the other messy, and we didn‚Äôt get along. I gave up trying to connect.

The friendships I do have feel shallow. I went to a small school growing up so making friends came naturally. But I was one of the few Black people where I lived and never fully felt part of the culture. I hoped college in the U.S. would be different, but I don‚Äôt feel like I fit into Black spaces here either. I don‚Äôt get a lot of the cultural references and it makes me feel disconnected.

I still hang out with my ex because he‚Äôs the closest thing I have to a close friend, but that‚Äôs not ideal. My parents live abroad, so I‚Äôve had to navigate everything on my own.

Academically and career-wise, I‚Äôm doing good. But it‚Äôs hard to enjoy any of it without a real community. I‚Äôve worked hard to become more open and social, but I have fewer people around than ever.

Most of my friends have graduated. My peers are turning 21 and I‚Äôm scared of being left behind. I even considered getting a fake just to see what that social life is like, but I don‚Äôt want to risk my future for that.

I‚Äôm getting a car soon and moving into a new apartment. These should be exciting changes, but it‚Äôs hard to enjoy them when I feel so isolated. I have so many interests but no one to share them with. People don‚Äôt really reach out to me unless they‚Äôre trying to flirt, so I feel like I‚Äôm bothering people when I start conversations.

How do I navigate this? I want connection. I just don‚Äôt know where to find it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lko2mf/too_young_for_the_college_experience/","2025-06-26 01:57:32","college","tbmee"

"Has anyone else used Kollegio to stay organized for college apps?","Not trying to promo anything, just genuinely curious if anyone else has come across a site called Kollegio. I started using it recently because I was feeling super overwhelmed balancing school, apps, and just life in general.

It‚Äôs kind of like a digital planner but made for students ‚Äî you can organize your goals, deadlines, college stuff, and even track your mental health. It‚Äôs pretty clean and easy to use. I like how it breaks everything into smaller steps, which makes the whole process feel less scary.

I found it through a TikTok and thought it would be some generic app, but it‚Äôs actually helpful. Anyone else tried it? Or have other tools you‚Äôre using to stay on top of things?

"My summer is miserable, help needed.","Hi, hope everybody's doing well.

I finished my GCSEs three weeks ago, and since I had to do 7 subjects within a year (I am an international student with no prior experience receiving secondary education in the UK which made it even harder for me) I naturally wanted to take a break during the summer holidays. I literally was studying insane amounts every day--I can't even remember a single day off I took last year. Thanks to this relentless grind, I scored 9s in every test, every quiz I took in school. However, quite obviously, I was so burnt out by mid-June. This was especially true bc last year was my first time living abroad away from my parents. So I was defo ecstatic to return home and finally enjoy life.

But guess what my parents decided to hit me with? 2hrs of AS content lesson 6 days a week. Plus they expect me to study 8 hrs every day. According to them those hours consist of: 2hrs lesson + 2hrs ucat practice + 2hrs reading + 2hrs tutor hw. Simply unrealistic!

And when I told them that this was too much, they told me that people my age were studying all day without even getting sufficient sleep. I swear I told my mum I just want to study 4hrs each day, but she started shouting, saying that a high schooler just mustn‚Äôt take on that type of complacent attitude.I told my parents I really needed this summer break to wind down in order to prevent burnout next year, hoping for some sympathy from them. But what I heard from them was: ‚ÄúEven though you take the summer off, things won‚Äôt be that different next year. And you don‚Äôt want people that studied hard over the summer to be better than you, do you?‚Äù

Whenever I look at my friends being carefree and enjoying their summer, I have to hold myself from bursting into tears. Studying has become a dreadful chore from something I genuinely had a passion for. And because I need to juggle SO MUCH all at once, I truly cannot focus on one task and I ACTIVELY FEEL my productivity declining.

It's not that I don't want to study or prepare for my future during the holidays. My goal was to immerse myself into dentistry (what I wanna do in uni) and read a lot of related books and articles. Perhaps do some work experience, and lightly skim over A-level content. I wanted to focus less on academics and genuinely have fun for once! But what I have to do right now is defo far away from what I envisioned. I mean, how am I even supposed to maintain my sanity with so much homework and pressure? Even when I asked my parents to reduce lessons they said they already paid the tutor so can't get a refund, and I was being too weak.

What can I do?? My life is miserable, I'm getting nothing done, and I hate how my summer is ticking past filled with rotten time. Genuinely, any advice would be appreciated.

Sorry this kind of turned into a rant. Hope you have a lovely day:)","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1lpw885/my_summer_is_miserable_help_needed/","2025-07-02 13:44:04","highschool","Live_Box_9507"

"RS Advice. I‚Äôm too ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù","Hey. I‚Äôm ngl this post is going to be all over the place as i‚Äôm writing this while i‚Äôm on a walk and have to pay around my surroundings. 

Background info: Okay so me and my gf (both 18) began dating in september 2024 and already graduated may 2025. The issue is , she‚Äôs friends (or was) with this guy (we‚Äôll call John) she‚Äôs known since freshman year. See , this whole issue started before we took an ap calc test in April , when john had walked up to me and told me ‚ÄúAye your girl has been looking at me a lot‚Äù and since him and i are friends, I just made up some bs response but after, I messaged my gf. She ended up sending multiple messages saying how she just zoned out and how the seating arrangement makes it so that they look at each other when they look up. I believe her because I remember last year, she would zone out a lot and stare at me or others for a while. During lunch, I didn‚Äôt really mention it until we got to our study hour/period and I had asked to see the messages they had. I almost cried reading them while in class, as her messages seemed more engaging than the ones with ours. She had used more emojis, showed larger responses (instead of crying emojis like she just does with me when i tell her a story) and she has a custom emoji that‚Äôs popping its head out of a cardboard box. It‚Äôs meant to be cute, and she used it with him. All of that really almost made me tear down as the way she messaged him, was the way she messaged me while we were still talking, and it felt like I was seeing the person i fell in love with, talk to someone else that way (if that makes sense). I didn‚Äôt do much after this. Just handed her the phone back but after school ended and we got home, we talked about it again. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want me to worry, she apologized and she also blocked him. Unfortunately, I decided to make it seem like it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal so I told her ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to as summer is about to start and it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôll see our classmates again‚Äù. This made her end up unblocking him and like I said, they continued to message more. So after this, they would talk more and on this Wednesday, he came up to me and told me ‚ÄúYour girl made me feel bad today because she asked me to get her a piece of paper and I said that she could get it herself‚Äù ‚Ä¶ after that, I got irritated with her. I told her why it was so easy for her to go back on her word ‚Äúnot talking to him and keeping him blocked‚Äù so this turned into an argument (she wasn‚Äôt arguing, it was her apologizing but she still didn‚Äôt block him. She actually blocked him after she asked him for help for a math test and I found out (by him) and that was the final time they talked. FYI I had no idea she blocked him until a week later when we were using each other‚Äôs phones as we didn‚Äôt have a lecture for AP lit. I decided to snoop around and found out that she was still talking to him and I told her ‚Äúyou said you wouldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore‚Äù she started saying that she didn‚Äôt but the messages were RIGHT in front of me so I couldn‚Äôt believe her at all. After that, I just gave her back the phone and I was quiet the entire time. Trying not to cry. I wanted to break up with her at that moment because she had gone back on her promise each time and did exactly the opposite of what she wanted to. I started writing on my notes app so that after class I could show it to her and break up and that‚Äôs exactly what I did. We didn‚Äôt break up as we sorta talked things out but she showed me that he indeed was blocked for over a week (and at first I didn‚Äôt believe she would keep him blocked but a few weeks later I checked his contact and he was still blocked). Oh I just remembered this, but this guy had an ex that he still talks about til this day but he‚Äôs honestly so weird talking to my girl like that but not with any of his friends. He‚Äôs so dry with them yet he isn‚Äôt with my girl. Not only that, he told her ‚Äúyou make these classes so much fun‚Äù even though he has classes with all his friends AND sits with them. He even has read receipts off for multiple people but not my girlfriend. Another thing is, we had a big test for one of our AP classes for december as it was finals and the teacher wanted it to be 2 at a table (as it‚Äôs a small amount of students in that class) and I was sitting in the corner waiting for my gf to arrive. She did but she ended up sitting next to HIM. Later that day, she also told me that they were both talking but she didn‚Äôt want to tell me what it was so I had to force it out of her and it wasn‚Äôt anything bad, it was just something she did she was embarrassed of and that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt want me to know. Another thing, she has this nickname she called him by (it was a freshman year class they had together and everyone did so idk if it‚Äôs right to be upset at this), one time after school, he waved bye at us but she thought he waved only at me so she yelled out ‚ÄúWow no Bye for me?‚Äù and thus other time during one of their convos, she asked what he had her as and she wasn‚Äôt happy with her contact so she said ‚Äúchange itüôÑput me as your fav best friend‚Äù‚Ä¶ funny considering that she‚Äôs against me having a girl bsf and i even blocked one of my female friends the moment she told me to AND i stuck to that promise. she‚Äôs still blocked. Alright so back to the main story, As we were in the library taking one of our AP exams, they sat next to each other while i sat a row behind them (seated by last names) so halfway through the test, I noticed that he had given up and he would turn to the side and smile at my gf and i couldn‚Äôt see what she was doing but I was certain she smiled back. I got pissed but I couldn‚Äôt do anything and then I saw that he was writing to her on the calculator and that made me even more mad. After the test, I just left her and went to class but I decided to come back to her coz she was waiting for me and wanted to talk. I told her how I saw her talking to him and all that and she denied it. I told her ‚ÄúWant me to ask him?‚Äù and she said yes. I asked him on imessage and she said ‚Äúyea your girl told me that you‚Äôre fine with me talking to her (he misread it coz she wrote to him on the palm of her hand) and that you think she‚Äôs cheating on you‚Äù. when I read that to her she smiled to hide the awkwardness I guess and I asked her why she had lied to me and I forgot what she said but I was pissed and basically started calling her a cheater. After that, she started crying and saying how she‚Äôs not a cheater and I told her to just reverse the roles and she said yea she wouldn‚Äôt be happy but I wouldn‚Äôt be a cheater. I told her she had lied to me and still engaged in a convo with him even tho she said she wouldn‚Äôt and she broke her promise multiple times. After this, she never talked to him again and I do remember before we graduated, we were taking pics for our ceremony and we were with a few friends. He walked up to us and he was looking at her a bit but she pretended to be on a phone call so he wouldn‚Äôt talk to her. 


Main thing:
Okay so after all of that background info, I‚Äôm writing this because even though it‚Äôs been months, I had a dream about it last night. It continues to haunt me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. The dream was that during one of our experiments for bio, the teacher assigned both of them to go take this bottle filled with soil and put it in the science room we have. What should have taken like 20 seconds turned into forever and they never came back. Worst part was, I could hear them talking and laughing. That was the entire dream (thankfully) but I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to tell her because last time we talked about this was about 2 months ago and I thought and she thought that we were past this. I know she would never cheat on me. She was the one to catch feelings first and she‚Äôs always reassured me with everything. I‚Äôve gone through her phone and she‚Äôs never done anything like that and she‚Äôs defended me from her friends multiple times. on top of that, her best friend likes me as well and so does her brother. I‚Äôm just worried and don‚Äôt know what I should do now cuz of this dream.

"High School Rivalry between two girls who barely spoke to each other","I‚Äôm a Grade 9 student, and there‚Äôs this Grade 11 girl at my school who **I‚Äôve spoken to through a friend but we're not close** or talk to each other, but we‚Äôve noticed each other *a lot*. It‚Äôs like this silent cold rivalry that never gets acknowledged, but always shows up in the background of our lives.

She‚Äôs really stylish and social, always smiling, always surrounded by people. I‚Äôm more focused on school and achievements, but we both seem to compete in the *vibe* department; outfits, hair, presence. Her favorite color is purple. Mine is pink. Somehow, we both lean into those colors and almost compete on who styles it better.

She sometimes does things after I do them‚Äîlike a certain hairstyle I wore regularly, she wore something similar soon after. Little details like crochet, bows, glasses, themed outfits. She‚Äôs not *exactly* copying me... but it feels like she mirrors things and adds her own spin. Enough that it‚Äôs noticeable. Enough that it messes with me.

Back when I was in 8th grade and she was in 10th grade, she used to stare at me a lot. I actually made a ‚Äúreport‚Äù about it in my notes because it was stressing me out. It‚Äôs not even that I hate her‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt know what her intentions are. We don‚Äôt talk. We‚Äôve never talked. But when I see her near my building or wearing a style I used to wear, something in me gets tense.

Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking. Maybe it‚Äôs all in my head. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt care at all. But when I walk past her, I still go:

‚ÄúUgh. There‚Äôs Zhenzhen again. >:(‚Äù

(Not her real name btw, I call her that like a code name.)

I‚Äôve even started writing fictionalized logbook-style posts about our indirect interactions. I feel like it helps me release the weird feelings without starting drama. But idk if I‚Äôm being too obsessed or if this is a normal thing to go through.

"Failed my physics regents. Feel like a failure.","My parents consoled me since they're the best so luckily I'm more calm now. But I was so distraught when I saw my score... 64. For context, I have done extremely well in physics all year. The lowest score I've gotten on a test was a 72. My teacher was great too. 

I could have studied harder, that's the only reason there is to it why I didn't do well. I didn't prepare enough. But the thing is, I couldn't. I literally couldn't. Leading up to the test I was down with a severe sinus infection. My mom even took me to the hospital the day right before the exam. I don't even know how I managed to drag myself to school the next day and take the exam with the medications and illness. I was so dizzy during the exam and the mask I was wearing was making it hard to breathe. I have never failed a regents before. The lowest I have ever gotten is a 70. 

I am very thankful that I can retake it, though. I don‚Äôt think retake dates have come out yet, but I will double down hard and study. I am sure I will be able to kill it in my second attempt.

But the thing is Mom had told me that she was doing just fine while I was gone to another State (My Mom & I both thinking that me moving & giving her some breathing room after she got discharged from her first mental hospital stay would help) well it didn't, I come back she's doing good for awhile then next thing BOOM!

But now that I am back living at home, she doesn't have her all to herself now so she's blaming me all over again. It has to make a person think & wonder, because all the time I was gone (a whole year & a half) my sister was just fine with my mom and just her. Then I come back and she restarts having mental breakdowns all over Again, which then causes ME to have Mental Breakdowns. Just this year on March 18th I was diagnosed with having full blown Schizophrenia & Schizoaffective. My sister has ONLY been diagnosed with Depression & Anxiety...... Last I KNEW Depression & Anxiety ISN'T the reasoning for people having (Hallucinations, Seeing & hearing things that aren't there, AND Paranoia on a 24 hour daily basis) Schizophrenia & Schizoaffective would more of a probable answer for those types of issues. I am NOT looking for (Mental Health advice) I'm just generally ASKING this question as a scream for help... Because I've been homeless for 4 years straight, & these reoccurring issues with my sister is leading me down that same path again (To wanting to go to a homeless shelter to get away from her but all those years of me being homeless My mother wants me to stay put she doesn't want her youngest daughter homeless ever again at all And after coming back I've told people I will stay in my home state until I grow old and pass I'm done with traveling I'm done with being rebellious & I am done trying to think I can be so independent that I don't need help, when the truth is I do from family) OR into Mental Hospitals where in MY past I've had those as my ""Safe Spaces"" which is BAD because they are temporary NOT permanent.

They don't have amazingly paid jobs, in fact he's currently unemployed. In massive debt. I don't understand how she thinks getting a chinchilla is a good idea! They don't walk their dog, barely look after the animals or house. 
When is enough, enough? How can I tell my friend that this isn't healthy and she's going to make that house even more gross and unkempt with more animals that they can't afford to look after! I'm worried about their kid, who is autistic and is not growing up in a safe, tidy house. It is truly gross. Routinely animals mess in there. Should I get firm with him? Or should I just butt out? I hate to see this spiralling because they are both so bad at adulting. I honestly don't care about the ex, but him.. he's a good friend and I'm worried for him and the child.

"My friends never last and I need help","Hi guys, I'm a rising junior in college and all I've seen that my friends have all fizzled out. I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong because I always reach out to people, and while I would have some response, it never sticks. For one reason or another, almost every friend I've met has either left or we have just fizzled out. Me and a friend decided to stop talking last year and because of this I distanced myself from our mutual friends (I realized after that most of my friends were her friends, but not my friends). I made some a new friend this semester, but no matter how much I reach out to her, she never responses. The same thing happened with my older friends.

I really want to leave college with atleast some solid friends (3-5?) that I can continue to talk with and I don't think that amount is large. I'd appreciate some help on what to do as I've already followed the typical advice-- joining new clubs, going to new places, inviting people I'm not close with to hang out. I

kinda hate myself for being like this and absolutely hate when I try over and over to reach out to people but no one replies :( This is me ranting, but I reached out to alumni and everyone raved about their friends and how their connections really stuck with them-- but I have no one that I'd even think of taking grad pics with.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lqootq/my_friends_never_last_and_i_need_help/","2025-07-03 12:46:28","CollegeRant","eithercryorpanic"
"Disappointed I have to retake","I took introductory statistics during the spring, and I completely bombed and ended with a D+. I have never gotten a grade this bad before, worse i‚Äôve done is C and i‚Äôm mad at myself that this happened. Im sad I have to retake the course (need c- for pre req) and waste more time redoing that on another course. I was going through a lot at the time so I failed the midterm. I thought I could make it up and I studied more and understood the material a lot more at the end but it wasn‚Äôt enough on final. I‚Äôm so mad I didn‚Äôt withdraw from the class, and now i‚Äôm sitting with a D+ on my transcript, and have to retake the class in fall because I need at least a C- as it is a pre requisite for a different class. On the bright side I got a A in different class so it might balance it out a bit, but i‚Äôm just so disappointed in myself and how I should have worked harder. I am bad at math and since i‚Äôve heard how hard stats was, I went in with the mindset I wasn‚Äôt gonna do well.

"I may have screwed up a major opportunity and I'm terrified (switching majors)","For context, I'm a 6th-semester Ivy student who was prior to yesterday double-majoring in neuroscience and English. Welp, I dropped my neuroscience concentration - sort of impulsively, but it may have been a long time coming - because I realized/admitted I didn't like it enough to tolerate a PhD/career in it. In studying neuro, I had intended to complete a PhD and attempt to break into pharma somewhere down the line. English, however - I couldn't be more obsessed with it (and have been since childhood), and (if all goes well) I'll be completing an undergraduate thesis and mayyybe a PhD in English (I genuinely really want to, but if it's either academia, the prospects for which are pretty abysmal right now, or being overqualified for jobs, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Still might do it, though lol). Thing is, I'll have accumulated about $130k worth of student loan debt upon graduating, and my parents cosigned my loans. I'm actually scared out of my wits that I'll be delinquent and they'll have to bear responsibility. Also, I'm not sure if I can re-add my neuroscience concentration at this point - I'm only halfway through its requirements either way - or if I even want to.

"Exhaustion and stress graduating in 2025","I feel like nothing is going the way I want it right now, I try to look at the positives but I just can‚Äôt find any. Right now I just want to rant and cry my heart out. I tried so hard in high school and even got into a uni which was literally the best choice for my major and it‚Äôs perfect for me in every way but because of the location I would have to pay over 40k a year just to attend which is so much more frustrating bc I was born and raised in that state. Alright fine well that dream is gone and my dad wanted me to stay close anyway so I decided to just go to an average state school but even when I felt like I was settling, they gave me a slap on the face with the 20k tuition which is insane for being in-state. I feel so guilty for my parents who agreed to help me pay even though they were struggling too especially with my dads unemployment but even more so depressed because it feels like all my efforts for the past years have been in vain. What‚Äôs even funnier is that my friends who barely tried in school are paying less than me just because they signed up for a program which I wasn‚Äôt aware of and could‚Äôve applied for, which would‚Äôve payed for 10k of my tuition. If their mom hadn‚Äôt forced them to apply the day of the deadline then they wouldn‚Äôt have known either. At this point what was the point of my hard workin high school? Why did I work my ass off in school when I could‚Äôve applied for a single program and be in a better standing than I am now? I feel so miserable right now and I can‚Äôt even find a job, it‚Äôs hard again because of the location. Life at home with my dad has always been cold but even more so recently.

"Telling my AP that I want to change my major...","Previously a Architectural Engineering Major (I chose this major because my dad told me to pick a major that would pay me 65000+, and it was also what I was mildly interested in) going to a community college, I want to change to Psychology. I hated AE for 2 years (been going for 3) and am supposed to transfer to another college next semester. My parents also want me to apply for an intership this summer. Truth is, I loved Psychology (interest started in Middle School, peaked in Highschool) and want to get a connected degree (Human Services to Psychology). I also have ADHD, so it's harder to concentrate and complete assignments on time (sometimes I need reread a page dozens of times to understand it). I also noticed that I was so interested in it that I didn't burn out during the middle of the semester like I usually do and managed to hold until the last two weeks where I slowed down (still passed). 

My APs hate each other and only stay together for my younger brothers (youngest is 10). My AF is emotional distant with my mom (also his mother treated my mom badly and he did nothing). My AM hates that my father (who works 7 days a week 8-10 hours) doesn't do considerate things (washing dishes, loading dishwasher, etc.).

My AF is already mad that I'm taking longer than the ""needed"" years (taking 5 years instead of 4) to finish my study (they don't understand that credits are what counts the most). My AM mentioned a few times that once I graduate, to get an apartment and take her away from my AF. Though, she (probably calmed down after seeing the rent prices) hasn't mentioned it for months. 

For reference, my mental health got so bad last year (summer through fall semester), that I got suicidal to runaway to deciding to stay after speaking to a counselor (college provides mental health service). There's also finances to consider. My father constantly asked if I applied for a loan (which I have not done yet). I was planning to pay it through, semester tuition is 2000-2500 for full-time students. There is also the fact that they want me to take 4 classes a semester, something I now understand that I really can't manage, 3 is my max. But they refuse to learn about or see the symptoms of ADHD.

I know I can't delay this much longer and need to tell them. My original plan was to email or text them this information while I was at work or something. Since I've been keeping this to myself, my anxiety and stress level is through the roof.

I‚Äôm a generally introverted person and I have a good amount of people I would call friends, but I‚Äôm not the kind of person who typically initiates or hangs out with people very often. I hate myself for feeling like I‚Äôm wasting some of the most fun years of my life and I want to be better this year. I frequent a handful of clubs but nothing meaningful really came from it last year, and I want to be better. The problem lies in that I don‚Äôt think I struggle socially if I‚Äôm comfortable but I can‚Äôt see myself starting conversations and making connections out of insecurity and shyness.

"It‚Äôs probably my fault but I just needed to see if anyone else has been here.","Not sure what to say really but I just wanted some outside opinions because I‚Äôm going crazy and it‚Äôs only like 2 months into dealing with this community college.

So this is my first year and first semester right now, before this I had no experience with college let alone the (very) shitty website this school provides and expects us all to use for EVERYTHING from scheduling classes to communicating with advisors. Literally anything I try to do in person is met with ‚ÄúYou have to go to the website and do XYZ‚Äù which has been really frustrating because the website is glitchy, inefficient, and confusing to navigate. Anyways since it‚Äôs my first experience with college in general I relied heavily on my advisor to help me plan and schedule my classes, and I made him very aware that I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do or how to do it considering the only help I have in my life are people who went to college over thirty years ago and don‚Äôt understand the technology aspect. He decided that based on that information he was gonna place me into accelerated classes that only run for 6 weeks and are incredibly difficult. Me, a freshman student. On top of that they weren‚Äôt even general education classes like English or math, they‚Äôre difficult and essential classes.

At that point in time I hadn‚Äôt realized the difficulty level involved in those accelerated classes, I assumed ‚ÄúOh, well they ARE intro classes so they probably won‚Äôt be that difficult hence the accelerated option being chosen for me‚Äù Fast forward to now and the classes are wrapping up and I feel like I got screwed over immensely and I‚Äôm very frustrated. For example my forensics class had a test every two weeks, however each test was 80 questions long and covered at least 7 chapters. I didn‚Äôt do well on a single one, the highest score I received was 71%. This was on top of multiple weekly assignments, however that part was totally fine and I did very well on.

I just don‚Äôt understand how my advisor expected me to do this?? Or anyone for that matter unless they‚Äôre just retaking the class. I‚Äôm confused and upset. Can I not truly not rely on anyone to do their job or help me navigate this difficult process that my future relies on? Like why would my advisor hear the info about me and decide that‚Äôs the best course? Also for others in accelerated classes do your professors also give you 3 or more separate tests that consist of at least 80 questions each with only two weeks in between? Or is that a fucking lot because it sure feels like it??

I just needed to vent and hear some other opinions because I can‚Äôt keep bottling it up like this.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1ljsjqd/its_probably_my_fault_but_i_just_needed_to_see_if/","2025-06-25 01:08:45","CollegeRant","haleyglover_"

I even argued with my therapist about it cause, yes im grateful for the job stability I have now, got my license finally after years of trying, yet I still feel like a massive loser because every failure along the way has been marked onto me and I cant Help but be reminded of them all whenever I attempt college. I was in college for 4 years and never made it to the second semester of my program cause I couldnt get a B in most of the classes, so I tried only doing 1 class and I still failed, I tried a workforce program in my college and failed that as well.

"Please be blunt with me‚Äì do I have a shot at getting into a good graduate school program? (LONG post)","I'd ask r/college, but they delete everything when I talk about my mental health. Fair warning for mentions of suicide, drugs, and abuse. I won't be going into too much detail, because that's gruesome.

So, when I hit high school, my mom turned to drugs which made her violent and abusive (to the point I had to worry about my life). This screwed over my high school GPA, which was a 2.4 (weighted).

So I went to community college, broke and unprepared, because I needed to get out of that abusive household. But because I was so unprepared, I failed all of my classes my first semester. I was also hospitalized for mental health reasons that semester, which caused me to give up and fail.

I retook all of my classes next semester and ended up getting around a 3.2~ish? So, not bad. Nothing below a B-. I did finish this semester, but around April after my finals, I attempted suicide. I lived (duh), but I never told anyone until a year later and I never went to the hospital for it, so nobody knew. All of my credits taken so far have been for either my biology major or general education. Nothing related to my current major.

I continued through online college, and decided to transfer when I had around a 3.0. Really not great, but not that bad. I transferred to a university that wasn't my first choice, but it was better than nothing. I was an animation major (I had no clue what I was doing, and I really thought an animation degree from a mediocre Midwest university would get me somewhere), so a lot of my credits from here were related to animation.

That year (2023/2024) I got hospitalized twice (both times during finals) for mental health reasons. I got a 3.889, though!

I decided to come back home to online college to finish up my associate's degree I never finished. I retook a class I initially failed (it was during my previous online period) because it was just a hard ass class, but I retook it and got a C. Hardest class I've ever taken and it was a level 200 gen-ed run by a guy who was disappointed his life never went the direction he wanted it to go. Anyways. I also got a good grade in my other class and bumped my GPA up to a 3.208.

Got my associate's degree now, finished last December and decided to take the spring semester off to save money for another school I wanted to transfer to. During the summer and fall of that year, I was hospitalized twice. During the fall and the winter of that year, I ""attempted suicide"" twice (I wasn't faking, I just don't know what else to call it and I don't want to get into details). Making three attempts in total. I was diagnosed with bipolar II after my third attempt (I also got diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD previously, but these didn't affect me as much).

I talk about all of this even though it's really hard for me because I believe it's essential to my story and who I am. I don't know how much I can talk about on college applications, which absolutely sucks. If I go too into detail, I'm seen as a burden and asking for pity. But that's not what I'm doing and I know for a fact I'm not a burden.

Anyways, today I have a combined 3.495 GPA, and I'm transferring to a local university much closer to my dad, that way I have support if something bad happens. But, with medications and being properly diagnosed, my hopes are high. I'm currently going to aim for a 3.9/4.0 (although as long as I have a 3.2+, I'll be okay, as that's the requirement for completion of the honors program). And the reason I'm so positive I might be able to aim this high is because if I can get a 3.5 unmedicated (with bipolar disorder, I need to stress, because that is a BITCH to live with undiagnosed) and unsupported, I think I can get even higher with proper medication and proper support.

I'm now going into marketing (I'm positive I'll stay with my major this time, because I told myself if I don't like it that's too bad), and I'm actually really excited for my classes. So, my first goal is to get a 3.9/4.0 (although I won't beat myself up if I don't get this!), and graduate with a couple internships under my belt. Next, I plan on working for a couple of years (needed for an MBA) while studying for my GMAT (my ideal score is 700+, again, won't beat myself up if I don't get this), and after my MBA and a couple of years with that, I want to get my doctorate and eventually become a professor. I'd also ideally maybe work with nonprofits.

Anyways, now that that spiel is out of the way, let's say these for a couple of examples: I get my ideal GPA of a 3.9, and I get a 730 on my GMAT exam (because I am going to study like a sonofabitch for it), I got good essays (maybe related to my personal experience, maybe not), I explain in my application that I had medical issues preventing me from reaching my full potential. I am also a female coming from an impoverished area, with parents who are both disabled. I am also first-gen, female, and white. I got good extracurriculars under my belt (including working since I was 16), as well as a couple of years (lets say two as the minimum) of relevant work.

I'm fine with getting into a small, nameless school for my MBA (if I choose that as my master's instead of something else). But that's not what I want. I want something that'll impress people. If I get the statistics I previously mentioned, I'll be applying to M7s. I do not expect to get into these M7s, but I'll beat myself up if I don't apply. More realistically, I'll be applying to T25s, preferably the University of Michigan. I'm looking for a fully covered tuition, or at least, half covered.

Be honest and blunt with me, what do I say on my applications, and what are my chances?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1li37jg/please_be_blunt_with_me_do_i_have_a_shot_at/","2025-06-23 00:37:50","CollegeRant","None"
"College has been nothing but pain","First off, I want to say that I'm in community college, so maybe that's why I'm experiencing the issues I‚Äôm about to vent about in this post. I'm a second-year student and will soon transfer to a four-year university. My experience with college has been horrible, and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one because no one else I talk to seems to be having the same experience.

Let‚Äôs start with the classes.

1. The professors suck. They don‚Äôt seem to care about us or the course itself. It feels like they just show up to collect a paycheck. Most of them teach by reading off crappy PowerPoints ‚Äî the kind they could‚Äôve just uploaded online ‚Äî but instead, they waste an hour reading them out loud and call it a day. Then they assign work that‚Äôs almost completely unrelated to the slides. I honestly wish I could get paid thousands of dollars just to read slides. Nice to know where my tuition money is going.


2. The students are assholes. I‚Äôve never met so many rude or fake people in one place. There are basically two types: people who don‚Äôt want anything to do with you, and people who just want to use you ‚Äî either for favors or something else. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone genuine. It‚Äôs also really hard to make new friends. The clubs at my school are worthless, and the people who do go to them are already in tight friend groups. I‚Äôve been to three different clubs ‚Äî big ones, like the gaming club and anime club ‚Äî and the average attendance is like four or five people. So I gave up. At this point, I‚Äôm more isolated than a prisoner.


3. College takes up so much time, and time is money  and I‚Äôm broke. To top it off, I‚Äôm not even sure I want to continue with my major. Thanks to some terrible teachers, I‚Äôve come to hate accounting, which is kind of ironic since it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm studying.



So to recap: the teaching sucks, the social life is nonexistent, and I‚Äôve grown to hate my major. Why am I even doing this?

I‚Äôm halfway through, so now I just feel obligated to keep going. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, because everyone else ‚Äî even people at my school ‚Äî don‚Äôt seem to have these issues. I didn‚Äôt expect college to be perfect, but the fact that I can honestly say I had better education in high school is wild.


TL;DR: The education sucks, the social life really sucks, and college is making me more miserable than I‚Äôve ever been.

"My parents make $0 and seeing other student's parents paying $200k+ for their tuition makes me sad","My parents are both disabled‚Äì the only reason they have a place to live is because our grandma lets us live at her house for almost completely free. But even before they became disabled, my dad was a roofer and my mom was a factory worker, so they weren't making anything spectacular.

My mom did have a small savings before she became disabled ($10k), which was a LOT to us, but she ended up blowing it all on drugs. That's the ""richest"" we've ever been.

I make more than my parents at $14/hr as a food clerk at Meijer. I do have a savings of $8.5k, currently. I am also in a lot of medical debt due to lots of psychiatric hospitalizations (maybe 7 or 8?). I currently have a collection marked as a derogatory on my credit score because I couldn't even afford $10/mo at the time it was given to me. (I completely forgot about this debt, and I have received nothing in the mail about it being in collections... I plan on calling them to see if I can resolve this, but I doubt it).

I went to community college to save money, but it ended up kind of screwing me over, as every university in the state doesn't offer free tuition towards transfer students (except for the University of Michigan, which is not only on the other side of the state, but I got screwed over because the dad I DO NOT LIVE WITH and get NO assistance from technically has assets over $120k, even though he makes $50k/yr). Grand Valley State did offer free tuition for transfers until last year. All these cool programs about free community college were not there when I graduated in 2021.

I have $15k in student loans (I'm in year four of college). Not great, not horrible. I'm saving my money so I'll be able to pay it off.

I'm awaiting to see if I won an $11,000 transfer student scholarship at my university.

Even with the full Pell grant, the full amount of loans, FSEOG grant, and scholarships and grants from the university and from outside scholarships, I still have to pay $5,000 out of pocket (hence why I'm awaiting to see if I won this scholarship). Good news is I'll get tuition reimbursement from Meijer, so this should go back in my pocket.

I just saw a post on r/FAFSA about a student who was a full blown millionare talking about his FAFSA. He proceeded to go into the comments and make insulting comments about poor families, as if it's our choice to be poor. This really hurt.

It also reminds me of the multiple times fellow students will come up to me asking ""what do your parents do?"" and I have to tell them every time that they're disabled and make literally nothing. People act shocked (albeit all of them have been supportive), but it makes me feel so out of place.

And I'm going to be real for a second, I am 100% envious of students who can afford to go to ivy leagues out of pocket and live in luxury apartments because of their parent's pockets. And sometimes seeing these people pisses me off, even when it shouldn't. I know better than to be angry, because it's good to see that somebody is succeeding in the world and has supportive parents, but at the same time, I can't really help it.

"Living home with my toxic dad","Hello guys. I'm currently a sophomore doing my summer classes. I recently withdrew from an intro to Philosophy course. To get straight to the point, basically I was super overwhelmed from the online class and simply the online class just didn't feel right to me so guys I thought withdrawing the course was good to save my GPA and that's what I did. I withdrew from the course. Fast forward, when I had this conversation with my dad that I withdrew from this course, he literally cursed me out and called me an a-hole for not asking for help and like he was so unhappy and so frustrated. Like I want a nice GPA even if it comes at a hard choice of withdrawing an online summer course like that. Withdrawing courses is not easy but I had to do it to save my GPA. Sorry if I sound like a neurotic kid but my GPA is 3.47 right now cumulative. I'm a chemistry major. A couple of things I didn't find right was that online courses are generally not suitable to me and the pace felt a bit too quick. I'm more of a slow learner when it comes to philosophy. I was simply overwhelmed with work guys. 

He cursed me out and made me feel so bad about myself, like yes dad I'm trying hard but sometimes I'm too overwhelmed to ask for help. HE LITERALLY SAID I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'M (MOSTLY) GETTING As and Bs IN MY OTHER COURSES!!! I EVEN TOLD HIM THAT BUT HE DISMISSED MY EFFORTS. For context, he pays the tuition of my university so he kind of has a right to intervene and ask me. That also pushes me to the halfway point always, should I move out and actually live my life I want in a college out of town but have to deal with not-so-healthy college foods and have to eat out at Chipotle or something to satisfy my hunger. I don't know man, he has been like this since when I was a young kid. But no hate to my dad, I love my dad so much and I will continue to love him but at the same time, man you gotta acknowledge my efforts. Anyway guys, what can I do in this situation guys? I am typing this at night so I may not be able to reply to you instantly but I might reply in the morning. 

  
TL;DR: My dad called me an a-hole and cursed me out and didn't acknowledge my mental health at all, I even communicated my efforts and yeah sometimes I got overwhelmed. I even communicated my efforts but he dismissed those efforts and even threatened me that if I continue down this road, expect me to call you (aka me) an even worse curse word.

"I ruined my GPA in a span of six weeks","I can't believe it. I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I was one of the few people whose marks actually went up from high school to uni. I decided to (stupidly) take two accelerated, online, six-week summer courses that spanned from early May to about now. I knew I was burnt out by the end of April, but the only reason I took those courses was to not be viewed as ""an unproductive loser"" (because I didn't apply to a summer job, and I was discouraged to as well, by my parents) by my household. I think I failed both courses.

I don't know what happened to me. I felt so unmotivated and procrastinated a lot during them. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought of doing a withdrawal from both but I didn't, because I thought I could push through. Now it's a stain on my transcript forever. I think I failed both. One of those courses is related to my major (economics), an intermediate level one, and now I'm discouraged that maybe I should switch majors. Despite me getting A's in the introductory courses and having a genuine passion for the subject. I'm devastated. I think this will only further my depression. I don't even know what I can blame; my laziness or depression. I may not even have depression; I may be unknowingly just using it as an excuse to mask my laziness. My parents are consoling me but I feel ashamed of myself. It's a nightmare.

I have no one to blame by the way. The professors were good, and the tests were fair. I only have myself to blame.

I knew I'd mess up at something. It seemed too good to be true that I had a 3.7 in my first year, given I've had one struggle after another since like 2022 (mainly personal/mental issues). I thought something was finally looking up for my life. But I was wrong. I'm back to square one. When I graudated high school last year and started university I had pledged to myself that I'd do well, and that university would be a ""fresh start"" after the worst 4 years of my life which was high school. Now I'm back to square one. Wow.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfqoyp/i_ruined_my_gpa_in_a_span_of_six_weeks/","2025-06-20 00:37:13","CollegeRant","ReactionWater7016"
"I was the crazy roommate back in 2023‚Äì it was horribly embarrassing and shameful","MASSIVE trigger warning for suicide.
I don't really know if this is a rant as much as it is ruminating about something terrible. I would talk about it on r/college, but that'd be a guaranteed post being taken down and/or ban. I guess I just need to open up about this.

So I was 20 and I lived with 18 years olds, we met on Facebook and decided to be roommates on-campus for 2023/2024. They seemed really cool.

We got along VERY well (in fact, my roommate had a crush on me, but of course I didn't initiate because I didn't want to date an 18 year old lmfao). We were very close friends.

Well, a couple months in, things started to sour a bit. One of our roommates was irritating everybody else. I had disagreements about how to do the chores (I don't even remember what it was about clearly), and I tried explaining this clearly quite a few times, they just never really got it (or they chose to ignore it).

They did quite a few things that pissed me off, and I do believe that they didn't like me because I disagreed with how to do chores and I was open about it. They were very messy roommates (got warned for their messiness right before I left, left shitty underwear on the counter, garbage everywhere, dirty dishes, used period pads in the shower...) and that irritated me. They expected me to pick up after them, basically.

They started being more and more cold to me as time went on. We started to dislike each other, two of my roommates started to gang up against me and my other roommate.

I'm very stressed out about my grades around this time, and I never told anybody, but I was deeply struggling with suicidal thoughts. When my roommates were gone, I would scream and curse to myself because of how stressed out I was (I was losing it, yes). My roommate did find a suicide note I left at one point, to which I just kind of... apologized to the best of my abilities, and I told her I was okay. She was actually pretty kind about it. She invited me to have tea and talk about fun stuff with her.

I was going crazy by this point. My thoughts made no sense and were very jumbled. I was barely stable in classes, but I did resemble a bit of sanity to the point people outside of my roommates thought I was normal.

I told my residence hall director what was going on. I was afraid to talk to my RA because I knew they'd want to have a group chat with my roommates, and I was afraid to confront them and be singled out even more. He just kind of sighed, made a little comment about not going to the RA, and he didn't really do much. He didn't take me seriously at all, obviously.

Time passes, and we eventually get into a big argument in the group chat. I don't remember about what other than chores and me feeling ganged up on. I was slamming doors and kicking stuff. Eventually, my roommate awkwardly comes into the bedroom and ignores me, and I guess I just kind of snapped. I muttered ""I can't do this anymore"" and grabbed all of my medication and went into the bathroom.

By this point, I took my phone and I called 988, because a small part of me recognized that I was not okay and I needed help. I ended up screaming and sobbing. I was minutes away from downing every pill I had and drinking a combination of all the chemicals I had around me. Fortunately, 988 called the police on me, and so did my roommates, because I think they suspected that something was deeply wrong. A roommate did knock on the door and ask if I was okay, to which I replied yes (I wasn't).

Of course, the police show up along with the person working at the front desk at the time, and I'm taken away to a cop car to the hospital where I was involuntarily admitted for about a week.

By this point, I thought I just had major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. I did have a suicide attempt about a year or two before this.

A week passes and I'm taken back to campus right as finals were about to happen. Great news, my residence hall director emailed me telling me there was an opening in the building, and there was another person seeking out a roommate because of their bad roommate situation. I did have to spend another night at my old dorm, and it was a little awkward, but it was calm. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about it.

Eventually, I did move out. It was awkward and silent between my roommates as I was packing up. My roommate did offer to help me pack very kindly. I refused the help, but I did thank her. And then I moved three floors down.

My new roommate was awesome. We did have a ""disagreement"" on how to do chores, in the sense that we had different ideas of what to do, but we came up with a scenario that worked for both of us very quickly and easily, they were very understanding and nice. We got along just fine for the rest of the year.

I did run into my roommates twice. One time, we ran into each other while I was leaving the dining hall. We smiled at each other and I opened the door for her, and she said thank you. Another time, my roommate left my stuff in a bag by my door that I forgot to pack with a note that said ""Have a great summer :)"", I emailed her thanking her and telling her to have a great summer back. And that was the last we heard from each other.

After this, I transferred back to my community college (partially out of embarrassment) and lived at home while I got my associate's degree (which I earned last December, and then I took the winter semester off). I attempted suicide two more times, and went to the hospital involuntarily three more times.

So, um... yeah, I was the crazy roommate. And I feel just horrible. I mean, really, really bad (as I should). I think I traumatized my freshman year roommates. I don't care how mean they were being towards me at the moment, what I did wasn't okay. But I didn't know what else to do. I was losing my mind.

And what breaks my heart even more is that they were so nice to me about it later. I did meet a friend of my roommate after that incident, and she told me that my roommate spoke about the incident and me poorly, but I really deserve that and I'm okay with that. I almost wish they weren't nice to me about it at all. I think they understood that I wasn't quite all there.

I think the only reason I wasn't academically dismissed is because I did tell my RHD I was struggling a couple of times, and my dad called the college and explained the situation/my mental health. I did have to talk to the student success center and keep visiting them. Trust me, I wouldn't have gone to college and gotten roommates if I knew my mental health was going to be that bad.

Later on (just about 6 months ago actually), I got diagnosed with bipolar II, not MDD. Which explains (but doesn't excuse) the crazy behavior. I'm finally properly medicated. I'm not even suicidal anymore, and I feel genuinely happy, even with the downsides in my life.

I'm returning to in-person college this fall. I am going to have my own personal bedroom, but three suitemates (couldn't afford a single bedroom), but please don't worry. If something bad happens, I only live 20 minutes away from my dad at this university and can stay with him, and I am much more prepared to tackle things this time due to being properly medicated.

So, um... yeah. I was the crazy roommate. And I hate it so much. I feel so guilty (like I should). I guess I just needed to talk about it and open up about it. I wish I could email my previous roommates and apologize, but I think it's better if I left it alone. Like I said, I guess I just need to open up about it. If you read this far, I appreciate it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfjc5m/i_was_the_crazy_roommate_back_in_2023_it_was/","2025-06-19 19:13:09","CollegeRant","None"
"Halfway done with college since last month and it's been a total shitshow","My college experience has been ruined by my shitty immigrant parents and mental illnesses. I knew the steps I needed to change but I just spiraled due to being scared and depressed and I blame myself for it

Firstly, I hate my parents a lot. My neurodivergence was a huge issue, but they made everything worse. They're Indian immigrant parents too by the way. They ruined the first 20 years of my life. They literally abused me a lot as a kid both physically and emotionally for the dumbest shit ever too, they just put pressure and expectations on me, they literally control and shelter me even at 20 and treat me like a fucking child and restrict me from freedom a normal teenager gets in the USA, and I'm pretty sure they only had my little brother and I so we take care of them when they're old or to see us as an extension of themselves. 

They got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis sometime in second to fourth grade, but didn't tell me until 7th grade just because I was too young. Hiding a diagnosis is one thing, but they constantly made me feel like a failure for those stuff and abused me. They KNEW the fucking reasons why I struggled with academics and social situations, had odd specific interests, struggled with attention span and comprehension, why I had to take special ed, why I had to take ABA therapy, why a doctor forced me on a gluten and dairy free diet in third grade and forced me to take some meds, and still fucking treated me like a failure and a bad kid. And until 11th grade, they absolutely REFUSED to get me a psychiatrist or meds. They don't understand my ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression at all and sometimes even downplay my struggles. 

Like they're overall shitty parents. They force me to adhere to Indian culture when I don't connect with it at all and also force Hinduism and some ridiculous superstitions on me when I am personally not religious and they believe you should blindly follow these stuff no matter what and take them very seriously. 

Both of them are narcissists, but my mom even more so because she has almost every textbook trait of a narcissist, so she is generally worse. 

I hate how they say they ""give us everything we want"" and even say they're more lenient than other parents when all they did was give a few toys and stuff for gaming we want and pay for college and expenses which is the fucking bare minimum. They even brag about the BARE bare minimum like giving birth, raising us, wiping our asses, food, clothes etc. 

They say we're the ones who are seeing them as villains and not communicating our feelings and assuming they'll say no, but it's straight bullshit. 

They don't give a shit about anything I like. In elementary school, I loved lego sets and after 5th grade, they stopped buying them just because that was the only thing I bought and they thought I was too old. Even for my 11th birthday with my OWN allowance and birthday money when I wanted to buy a $120 lego set, they didn't let me for that stupid reason. In high school, I was passionate about gaming and even wanted to go pro or make content, but even on summer break, they only let me play 1.5 hours on weekends. And even now in college they're controlling. Like last year when I picked apartment housing for sophomore year, they fucking made me screen share and made me put reqs as no beef, no drinking, no smoking. Im still forced to follow religion and culture blindly, they force me to go on vacations with them or dumb gatherings with family friends. Like I'm 20 for fucks sake and still treated like 12. 

They have high expectations and think anything below a 3.5 is a bad GPA and they say we're lucky they don't expect 4.0. 

They just use the ""give everything you want"" and ""we pay for college and everything"" lines as leverage to control us and later use it in the future. They literally made us study in breaks and only care about us being successful.

Secondly, I hate myself for having ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression. ADHD and Autism fucking ruined my life since childhood. Like I said, it made me struggle academically and socially, made me mentally immature and behind, and have weird interests.Those weird interests made it hard for me to connect with people my age that since middle school, I withdrew myself completely because people became more judgy. While they were into normal interests like sports, pop culture, and TV shows better for their age group, I was still into shows considered childish and toys and even that way in high school. 

My anxiety and depression started in 6th grade too. I was even delusional until 12th grade just every day wishing for some magic powers, which is stupid I know, but it happened and one of the reasons I ruined my life. I did read that child abuse affects amygdala and hippocampus, which increases risk of anxiety and depression, which is probably why I have those two. 

Because of my parents and mental illnesses, I literally missed out on 20 years of my life and experiences like friends, partying, sports, dating, sex, being popular, having a fake ID etc.. Combine that with my parents pressuring me to get out of comfort zone and shell all the,  making friendships and socializing feel draining, and not assimilating to US culture and teaching us how to be socially successful just made me avoid everything. 

It also doesn't help that everyone these days also says that being shy, having no friends, and not fitting in is okay when that's the reason why most of my generation sucks. 

Fast forward to now where I halfway finished college a month ago and it's been an absolute shitshow. I'm at ASU and ever since I stepped foot in it on day 1, my life became much worse. I was placed with outgoing roommates who love to party. That was when I hated myself for how I was and wanting to be introverted when I kept hiding. Like I remember even one hot girl liked me and I didn't believe it. 

After that semester, I wanted to party but I realized you have to be in a frat to party. I wasn't confident enough to rush and then missed out and said I would do it the first sem of sophomore year. Just being lonely and dwelling on the past so much made me more miserable and spiral more that my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 3.59 and just rot more. 

But I did NOTHING to improve myself and just waited and then it came and I got no bids from the houses I rushed. You'd think I'd improve myself this time, but I fell in a worse spiral and tanked my GPA  to a 3.46 instead, even skipped classes for a whole month, and even had a shitty diet and worked out less. Then 4th sem came and this time same shit. It sucked because I actually tried this time and was more social and cracked jokes and everyone was gassing me up and even in one of the other frats I knew 4 guys from freshman year and 3 of them had exec positions and even acknowledged my change, yet I didn't get in a SINGLE invite only event. It sucks because sophomore year is generally the last time to rush. I know I could've gotten in a bottom house and still can in junior year because they bid anyone, but I hate them because they're like 40 members at most and all rejects who only joined because they were rejected from actual frats just for the sake of being in one, but they're still irrelevant. 

I know most people go to bars instead of frat parties and frat parties are usually off campus, but I really wanted this shit since second semester of college to meet a lot of people quickly and be popular and that's what I based my whole identity on to get in those specific frats. Even though people still tell me I can make a few drinking buddies and a girl and even if people drift after college, it sucks ass at the moment not being in a frat, especially under 21. 

I literally vowed that if i get a bid, I'd start getting my shit together.And it does seem like many people who party are in the frats I just hated everyone in greek life since then and hated people in general. The decent frats are mostly people who have been ready since HIGH SCHOOL. Many of them are even PROUD of being exclusive, but I bet a lot of them never had to deal with neurodivergence or a shitty upbringing. It sucked how they straight up gassed me up and cut me early. I'd rather have been straight up INSULTED and beaten up and thrown out rather than whatever the fuck that was. I hope a day comes where I get to beat these people up because after this rejection from the frats when it was my last chance to rush, I don't have a chance at the most optimal college experience possible.

I don't wanna join a club or just talk to people in classes because clubs are for nerds and nothing like frats. And I DO wanna party which most of these losers online are against. That semester was the worst that I even failed a class and tanked to a 3.29. I hate being told to just make the best out of everything. I was too scared coming from abuse and being sheltered and neurodivergence into college and anxious to talk to people because they wouldn't like me. This frat shit was the only shit I wanted in college and I have no chance anymore. 

My life gets worse every year, but ever since I started college, it's been much worse. I just hate myself for my fucked up mind making me miss out on everything. 

I don't know if I'll ever have a college experience as I hoped. I fucking hate this place and can't wait to graduate. I'm just so bitter and resentful towards the people having what I have and towards the people who excluded me. I hate my parents for not knowing how to be good parents and not assimilating to US culture and learning how to be cool. I hate myself for constantly spiraling and blowing up the last chance at rush. Sure I can get some drinking buddies and a girl and most people go to bars when older, but it won't feel the same as being in a frat.

"I shouldve never listened to my sister and now idk how to twll her about my choice for community college","Hi. I am a recently graduated high school student who was persuaded into applying to UC Merced instead of going to CSU Chico. I was dead set on going to Chico and even excited to see a brand new part of California even if it meant leaving my family far away. My sister pushed me to the only UC I got accepted to because ‚ÄúUCs have better education compared to CSUs‚Äù So I withdrew from Chico and thought I wanted to go to Merced even though they didn‚Äôt have the major of my choice (rlly dumb ik) sooo I was like ‚ÄúI GUESS ill go because UCs are better and I‚Äôll become a pharmacist instead of registered dietitian‚Äù So I attended Bobcat Day and explored UC Merced. Although the campus is nice, it was in the middle of no where and js not rlly catching my eye. But I still forced myself to like it because my sister arranged this JUST for me and spent a good amount of money along with my dad. After some heavy consideration, I didn‚Äôt want to be away from my mom. I know it‚Äôs nice to give yourself some experience away from home but I realized I am too young/I have no experience. And my mom is moving to houston at the end of the year so I was like ‚ÄúI rlly hate UC Merced, I‚Äôll just go to community college js so I would be close to home, save money and get into a school I actually want to go to.‚Äù Altho many people dunk on CC, I think it‚Äôs a great pathway for those unsure of what they want to do with their lives. I would rather go to a CC and not know what I want than go to a university and force myself to do a major that isn‚Äôt what I want. However I have yet to tell my sister. She helped me get house (for free) and helped me through all the admissions. I just know she is going to be pissed off once she learns that I don‚Äôt wanna go to university for the full 4 years. And I want to go to CC. She looks heavily down on CC (even tho she went to one and transfered to UCSB) and told me to at least go to UC Merced for one year even though I told her that is not what I want. I feel extremely controlled by my sister and it‚Äôs giving me stress thinking about how angry she will learn that I want to be near my mom. I shouldve js picked a community college from the beginning instead of a university i dont even like.
And even though financial aid covered for a lot of my stuff, I still have no interest in UC Merced. 
I rlly wanna go to Purdue, UCSB, University of Maryland, GWU, UCSD, Texas A&M or even UCLA if the chance comes around!

(Im sorry if this is missing details or more context is needed, I can give more in the comments)

What I am asking is how should I approach her about it and what if she tries to convince me to go to a University I didn‚Äôt like just because she never was able to do the full 4 years?

"If I medically withdrew from college, how likely am I to be accepted at a new one?","
Hello everyone,

I graduated high school in 2017. My parents told me at the time that they would help pay for college *if* I chose a Christian college. I ended up choosing Colorado Christian University and was accepted. I started in their 2017 fall semester. 

For reasons that would take far too much time to explain (suppressed queer identity, *nasty* break-up, etc), I ended up *severely* depressed during just that first semester. So much so that I was skipping classes and even skipping *midterms.* Obviously, my GPA tanked. Professors and advisors reached out to try and help, and I blew them all off with excuses about 'family emergencies, work, blah blah' whatever bullshit excuse I could think of, anything but admit that I was incredibly suicidal. 

A short time later, I was put on Financial Aid Hold, which is was alerted my parents to the situation. I finally told the professors and advisors the truth about my situation, and they pretty unanimously suggested I Medically Withdraw from school. After a few counselling sessions, that is what I did. 

  
Now, here I am, years later, with no degree and wanting to go back to school. I'm worried, however, about my chances of being accepted to a new school with my record. Do any of the aforementioned things impact my likelihood of being accepted, or impact my likelihood of receiving financial aid? If so, is there anything I can do to.... 'fix' it? What are my options?

___


Edit: (unnecessary little vent, entirely irrelevant to the main point of my post ‚Äî just reflecting back):


It‚Äôs really daunting and frustrating to be 26, and finally begin to realize just how much my choices as an 18 year old are still messing with my future today. I have grace and kindness for that 18 year old ‚Äî they were an absolute wreck, confused, lonely, angry, careless. But that 18 year old also pretty royally messed up their own future. I wish I had taken a gap year rather than jump right into college at 18 when I wasn‚Äôt even sure I *wanted* to go to college; I wish I‚Äôd been honest with my professors right when the trouble started, because maybe then there would have been the chance to save my grades. Frankly, I wish I‚Äôd never chosen CCU lol, for a lot of other reasons. 

Because now, it feels as though that angry and sad little teen burned all my bridges. And in this economy, even people *with* degrees are struggling to find work ‚Äî so it probably comes as no surprise that I‚Äôve been out of work for a year now, despite endless applications and attempts at finding *anything.* 

It‚Äôs strange, because 18 year old me definitely didn‚Äôt expect there would ever *be* a 26 year old me. I wasn‚Äôt concerned for my future, because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have one. Now, im in that kid‚Äôs future, wishing I‚Äôd done so many things differently.

"I think I fucked up...","I might have failed two classes this quarter. I don't know my grade yet. I am PANICKING. I might not get to switch to my intended major. And what happens when you fail? I'VE NEVER EVER FAILED A CLASS EVER IN MY LIFE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

And it's not even like I have a good reason, I've just been extra down in the dumps this quarter and falling off because it was spring. I don't party or anything. I don't have some severe family tragedy occuring. I went to every lecture. But I don't have very good study skills and these classes were hard. I have just kind of been a zombie attempting to go through the motions. I've been dropping the ball in other areas of life too. I have nothing to show for any of this.

My professors haven't finished grading, so maybe there's hope. But the suspense is killing me and I'm also planning on taking summer classes. I want to get internships and stuff sometime but with these grades I probably never will. I feel like I'm drowning. Help.

"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here. I just feel like a loser. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l8w54k/i_think_i_need_help/","2025-06-11 15:48:54","CollegeRant","temporaryboi_"
"why cant i get hired","Hey everyone. I'm (M,21) am currently saving up money over the summer for an apartment for the school year off campus.

"Update to Metadata Saga>","Just wanted to share a quick and honestly kind of hilarious update to my previous rant about my school accusing students of academic dishonesty based on document metadata, shared templates, and even bold text. The most ironic part is that all of this happened in a Social and Legal Relationships in Forensic Science class. A class literally about how evidence and legal systems work was punishing students for things like metadata they didn‚Äôt understand, formatting choices, and templates given by the instructor. They were teaching us about due process, burden of proof, chain of custody, and fairness in criminal investigations while simultaneously saying that having two authors listed in a Word document was probably cheating. The standard of evidence they used was ridiculously low basically if something ‚Äúlooked suspicious,‚Äù that was enough to accuse students, and the burden was on the students to prove their innocence. If it wasn‚Äôt so damaging to students, it would be comedy. They kept insisting the process was educational and not punitive, yet students were flagged, questioned, stressed out, and sometimes penalized for normal things like bolding subheadings or using the provided file. The hypocrisy was wild.  It was lower then even a civil court case. Now that I‚Äôm officially an alum, I can fully say I survived the academic integrity circus and the irony that came with it. Thanks for all the support and validation on the last post .You all made me feel way less crazy.

 **TL;DR** The cheating accusations over metadata, templates, and formatting all came from a forensic science class about law and evidence. They used a ridiculously low standard of proof basically just ‚Äúlooks suspicious‚Äù was enough to accuse students, and it was up to the students to prove they didn‚Äôt cheat.

I am 19 and live in Washington state..I've been going to a local community college and I keep failing classes even though I do well on the quizzes and tests+ regular assignments, normally 80% or higher, I've gone for 2 quarters and failed every single class because of some technicality or cause of my disability keeping me from doing work for a couple days (I have a congenital heart condition) I have had a professor tell me to drop her class when I told her I couldn't do work a certain day because of my health issues, I understand that college is different than highschool, but I went to a different college on the opposite side of the state right after graduating HS and they were great, I loved the campus and the professors were understanding and very kind...I could not continue attending due to my health declining due to lack of medical services in the area..
My current college I attend is so difficult for online students, which f ING sucks, my auntie just graduated with her 3rd degree from there and she did not have this hard of a time at all! 

I was trying to look into online universities, the main 2 that come up are FullSail and SNHU which are both way too expensive...are there any good online school options?

"Retaking a class I got a B in","I retook a Calculus AB class I took last year. I had a B+ first semester, and a B second semester. I initially had an A, but my math teacher intentionally lowered my grade after the finals were all complete without any explanation. (Specifically my grade) When I questioned him about it, he gave BS answers like ""This is a hard class, there's no reason for you to get an A"". I was really upset, because there was no reason for him to do that. I also don't know why he would have the time to change an individual student's grade. It was well above an A, and no other assignment would have changed it. 

I retook the class recently with a different teacher and got an A just fine both semesters. 

Now I'm concerened what story this will tell to the Ivies and the T20 schools. Will this decrease my chances and make it seem like I'm obsessed with my grades? Is there a note I can add to let them know about this situation? Both grades will show up on the transcript.

"Returning to same college after 5-6 years?","I attended a community college in 2019/2020. At the time, I was doing a 2 year transfer program. I was also unsure of what exactly I was doing, I really only went because... I didn't know what my other options were. Life happened and I got married, moved, and didn't consider going back to school. 

I've recently moved back home and near the community college I attended. I'm not as busy, my husband and I are more financially stable, and I can afford to go back to school and just focus on that. However, I am 100% confused on what exactly my first step should be. 

I was able to log into my school account, as well as my old school account's email and everything else. The issue is, I don't know if I should do another application or not. I would assume I shouldn't, but if I don't... I have no idea where to go from here. I've emailed the admissions email a couple months ago, before I was ready to actually go back to school, just so I knew what I'd need to do. I never got a response. I also called during their open hours, but the phone never got picked up. I've emailed them again today, through the school email, but I doubt what email is used makes a difference. 

I just want to be semi-prepared for whatever is it I might need to do in order to go back to this school. I know I'm not the first person to have such a huge gap and not know where to start when going back.

"What's the reality of college expenses?","*Edit:
More Clarification. I was born in Utah, lived in Japan for a bit, but most of my school years were spent in Oklahoma. My parents are Texas residents and I'm a dependent. Moved to the UK the summer before my sophmore year of high school, and right now Im preparing for my senior year of high school on an American military base in the UK. My dad has been in the military for about 22 years. Im currently 17 and an African American male. Definitely middle class, maybe slightly upper-middle class.

*Other Edit

OKAY, so I suppose I should've asked my parents more about why they said I'd pay for in state tuition. Since I was born in Utah, would I be considered a Utah resident? I'm slightly confused now. In any case, I've done a bit of research and luckily my dad seems to fit all the criteria for the Hazelwood act at least 
-----------------------

Original Message:

Hey, I‚Äôm a rising senior and I‚Äôm seriously stuck right now.

I already know I‚Äôm not getting into any T20s, and I‚Äôve accepted that. My SAT is a 1220 (retaking it this fall) and my GPA is around a 3.8 unweighted (all A‚Äôs so far), so I‚Äôm solid but not Ivy-bound. I've got a decent set of extracurriculars, taken some AP classes, and I've been told I write great essays, so I think I have a solid shot at the schools I'm applying for.

I‚Äôve done some stuff like leading at a summer camp, , some awards and student gov, and I‚Äôve been living in the UK because my family‚Äôs military, which I'm going to try and utilize for my personal essay.


Here‚Äôs the dilemma:

My ‚Äúdream schools‚Äù  are places like UMass Amherst or CU Boulder. Something about them just feels right‚Äîcalm, scenic, inviting. They make me actually want to try. But they‚Äôre so freaking expensive‚Äîlike $45k‚Äì$60k a year expensive. I‚Äôd probably walk out with $80k‚Äì$120k in debt, and I don‚Äôt even know if UI/UX or design would pay enough to make that worth it.

Then there‚Äôs Texas.

Because of the Hazelwood Act, I could basically go to any Texas public school with no tuition. I'm also an in-state Texas resident. I know my parents would be happy with wherever I go, but I‚Äôm starting to think about money more realistically and I really don‚Äôt want to drown in student loans.

But also... I don‚Äôt wanna stay in Texas. It feels loud, hot, kinda intense. Like if the world went to shit, Texas would be the first to go down lmao. I also don‚Äôt really wanna be close to family. I love them but I want space.

I just worry that Texas would feel kind of suffocating and I wouldn't fit there.


Even schools like A&M (which is rural???) or UT Austin (long shot anyway) don‚Äôt excite me. I looked into Texas State, UNT, UT Dallas, and while they seem fine, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll just feel super unmotivated being there. Like I‚Äôll feel stuck.

So yeah. Do I go where the vibes are right and risk serious debt? Or do I go where the money makes sense and risk feeling like I sold out my future?

If anyone‚Äôs been in this situation, or has insight, please be honest with me:

Did you regret going to your ‚Äúdream‚Äù school because of the debt?

Or did you regret picking the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù option and feeling like you plateaued?

Can the right people and mindset make even a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù campus feel good?

I just don‚Äôt wanna make a decision I‚Äôll hate in 5 years.


(Also if anyone is a Texas college student, what are your thoughts on whatever school you're at? Feels like there's not many good options besides A&M, UT-Austin, and Rice..)

"Will colleges that I apply to be able to see a college class I took?","I'm currently taking an online class through my local community college so I'd be able to get some early credit. Unfortunately, because I was working at a summer camp for a week (completely unplugged, no service, no time to work on assignments) I was unable to finish a really important assignment that was worth a lot of points. 

So now, even if I finish the rest of the course with perfect scores, I'd still have a high C at best. Now, this was totally out of character for me and really irresponsible. I've literally gotten only As throughout my entirety of school, am ranked valedictorian, and am always on top of things. I could've done the assignment before camp, yes, but I was burnt out and really stressed and didn't get around to it. My fault.

The class has a no-late work, no extra-credit policy and my excuse for missing the assignment is incredibly weak and not even worth mentioning to the professor. 

So now I'm just incredibly paranoid and stressed out that when I start applying for colleges this fall (I'm an upcoming senior) that this class will be on my transcript and colleges will see my C. Now, I have no idea how this works. I don't even want the credit for this class anymore, I just want to know if there's anything I can do to get this class off my transcript/know if it will even be on there. 

TL;DR - I did terrible in a college class, I don't want the credit anymore, I just want to know if colleges will be able to see the class when I apply.

"Appealing - school denied my final semester","Hi everyone  
  
I‚Äôm writing this post because I recently received news that my school won‚Äôt let me proceed to my final semester, and I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm appealing the decision but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll work, and I‚Äôd really appreciate advice or support.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I had to undergo two major surgeries for medical reasons at the start of my 6th semester (7 semesters in total).
* I‚Äôve been living alone since both of my parents passed away in 2023. When I began school in 2022, they were alive and I lived with them, so I had financial stability (I was 24 at the time).
* After their death, I‚Äôve been managing everything alone: paying rent, working 80% (4 days/week) just to survive while doing 2.5 days of school and studying weekends for almost weekly exams, doing my assignments etc.
* I‚Äôm also undergoing HRT since 2022, which has been medically necessary for me.
* Despite being under extreme stress and depression, I still passed most subjects. I was only half a grade (!!!) short of making it through.
* I had repeated a year before due to the emotional toll (HRT and parents), but I bounced back.
* The school was cold and inflexible about my situation, even when my surgeon had to step in to confirm the surgeries‚Äô importance. They didn't want to let me get my surgeries basically and I had to fight for it.
* I feel this is deeply unfair since I‚Äôm six months away from graduating and I‚Äôve fought through things most people thankfully never have to.

I‚Äôm appealing the decision, attaching documentation like the surgery confirmation, death certificates (perhaps optional since they're confidential to me), employment records, mail exchanges with my doctors, and more.

Any advice on how to word this better, or similar experiences? Do you think I can receive empathy to my situation?

**TL;DR:**

"My parents are taking my degree choice way too personally and it's weird","Swear my mom takes my psychology degree as a direct insult to her life choices like every family gathering turns into backup plan resolutions. Like mother, this IS the plan and dad keeps sending me indeed links for real jobs and I'm just trying to survive organic chemistry over here. Love them but damn, can a person just pursue their interests without it being a whole family crisis like at least tuition stress is way less now so I can actually focus on classes instead of constantly worrying about money.  
  
The way they act like I chose psych specifically to spite them is sending me lmao. Mom's out here like I could be an engineer while I'm drowning in research papers about cognitive behavioral therapy. Anyone else dealing with family members who think your education choices are a personal vendetta against their parenting?

"Should I drop out of university because of mental health? Advice needed.","Hi, Sorry if this is long! I‚Äôd greatly appreciate if you took the tiime to read it.

I‚Äôm heading into my final year of uni after taking a mental health break, and I‚Äôm seriously considering dropping out.

I took a year off after a rough period‚Äîmy mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.

For context, i‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I‚Äôve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.

Since January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven‚Äôt been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîmeds, structured routines, new environments‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt focus or motivate myself. It‚Äôs like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.

Now I‚Äôm questioning everything. I don‚Äôt enjoy my course and can‚Äôt picture myself in a 9‚Äì5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing‚Äîespecially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I‚Äôm terrified this would confirm it.

I want to get better, but I don‚Äôt know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.

Any advice or support would mean a lot. Thanks üòä","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lp987x/should_i_drop_out_of_university_because_of_mental/","1751394119.0","college","Better_Sprinkles_286"

"I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind this upcoming semester","I (F21) just attended orientation for my university. I'm moving hours away from home to a city I‚Äôve visited a grand total of one time.

I'm a psych major who wants to go to grad school. I'm also the obnoxious student who's in 10 different clubs. Last year, while I was still in community college, I balanced Student Media, occasional student government meetings, PTK, helping to organize campus events, and SkillsUSA‚Äîall while taking classes, applying to multiple universities for transfer, and working on campus, sometimes up to 20 hours per week.

I blame this on my ADHD, really, because my brain goes, ""HEY, I WANNA DO THAT THING!

So I do the thing... kinda, sorta. I usually procrastinate, barely hold everything together, and break down every so often. But I do get it done, so yay?

So, as I'm leaving for university, I'm unfortunately taking my neuroticism with me. But I'm also severely burnt out. I have been for a while, really.

And yet, I‚Äôm actually really excited for school‚Äîmeeting new people, learning new things, research, all that fun stuff. I have a really weird love-hate relationship with academia.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôve already started stressing out, as orientation has been a huge information overload. Do I apply for internships right now? A job? Volunteer work? Organizations? What‚Äôs the appropriate level of proactiveness? Why am I the only loser attending any of the optional sessions?

Anyway, I'm seeing a therapist on Wednesday, but I‚Äôd love to hear any advice from people who‚Äôve been in university longer‚Äîpreferably if you‚Äôre anything like me (I‚Äôll pray for you)‚Äîon how you manage your schedule between class and extracurricular activities.

"I‚Äôm switching paths‚Äîneed help choosing a major.","Hi all, I‚Äôm currently studying in Italy in a bachelor‚Äôs program called *‚ÄúSocial Innovation, Communication, and New Technologies‚Äù*. It‚Äôs an interdisciplinary degree mixing computer science, design, and social sciences. I originally picked it with the goal of becoming a UX designer or digital marketer‚Äîsomething job-ready and practical.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve realised I don‚Äôt want to work in tech or design anymore. What I really care about is **academia**, **research**, and working in institutions like the **EU**, **UN**, **NGOs**, or **think tanks**. I want to do a **master‚Äôs (probably abroad)**, then hopefully a **PhD**. Ideally I‚Äôd like to end up in Belgium, the Netherlands, or maybe stay in Italy.

Right now, I‚Äôm torn about what to do. My current degree feels too applied, and I‚Äôm seriously considering switching to something like:

* **Political Science**
* **Sociology**
* **Economics**
* or even **History** (though it feels a bit abstract and less ‚Äúmarketable‚Äù)

The upside is that I‚Äôm not taking on any debt (I get a stipend) and both my BA and MA would be **fully funded in Italy**, so I have flexibility. I just don‚Äôt want to waste time in a degree that won‚Äôt get me where I want to be.

"Feeling directionless and lost as a senior, need advice","I'm 21 and after this summer I will be going into my senior year of college. I'm a double major, currently pursuing studio art and statistics, and plan to go to grad school for statistics. My issue is less that I don't have any job prospects (even though I don't), and more that I actually have no idea what I want to do for my future. I'm incredibly behind in my statistics degree, but on top of that I don't even think I want to work a stats job for the rest of my life. My main passion is video game concept art but I doubt my ability to succeed in that industry because I know so many talented artists with more internships under their belts and better portfolios, but the thought of doing stats for the rest of my life feels like a drag. I am currently working on looking for a job as a caricature artist, but even with caricature work I'm worried people would look down on me for it since it's not really considered a high skill job, even though I really enjoy doing it and have made some good money off of it in the past. I also doubt my ability to get a job as a statistician. Overall, I feel behind my peers in so many ways, feel lost and directionless for my future, and it's too late to change my major so I just have to graduate. I feel like I'm gonna end up going back to college when I graduate but I don't even know what I would pursue and the thought also makes me feel like a failure.

"I feel like a loser for taking more time to graduate","Trigger warning (in case): Depression   
  
  
TLDR: I failed my first attempt at my bachelors thesis and I am depressed and ridden with guilt and fear of breaking the news to my parents.   
  
Hi everyone, I (22F) started college September 2021 for my bachelors degree in International Business. Currently I am in my fourth and final year and we have to do a thesis and a defense as our final projects with an external company. Unforunately, I got the news recently that I failed my recent attempt at my thesis report so therefore, I won't qualify for a defense, and will have to attend a feedback session next week to get information on how to improve on my next submission which will be in September. Sure, it is only 2 months and that's hardly a delay but I still feel like a loser as people around me of course are passing one by one and are graduating in July which was supposed to be me but not now. 

For more context, the way it works at my uni is to do an internship in my first semester of my fourth year and then a thesis project with preferably the same company or different. Luckily, I was able to get an extension with the company that I was already with as they liked my work and the team also liked me.  
  
This entire process was super difficult as I was working as an intern still at that company 32 hours a week, I also had to attend some classes for uni in between, I was also taking language lessons in between as I was also planning to get a permanent residence card of the country where I am currently located in as I have lived there long enough and are eligible.   
  
I realized too late that I was burning out rapidly and I already struggle with depression and anxiety and my home life isn't great either as I still live with my parents. I honestly dropped the ball during the process. I take full accountability, but it still hurts. I have let down myself, my parents and some lecturers who really believed in me and my potential. I still need to break the news to my parents as well but I am so scared and my mental health has deteriorated so much in the past months that I am also in therapy now with the emergency hotline. 

I do want to graduate. I‚Äôve already been accepted into a pre-master‚Äôs program I wanted but I have to postpone that now to the next academic year and also my parents who pay for my tuition have to pay for an extra 2 months and I just feel so guilty.

"I don‚Äôt know what to do and need some advice","Hello sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors I‚Äôm typing this super late from where I‚Äôm at but I need some advice. I‚Äôm a rising senior and switched my major from computer science to data science, although they are similar data science at my school has a lot more courses. I‚Äôm also a dual major but I‚Äôm finishing that major up quickly. I planned on taking 3 more semesters so I could graduate a semester later. However I got super tired and depressed and couldn‚Äôt really take any of my classes that semester and withdrew from 2 courses. My biggest fear is that was going to happen again as that semester was super light and I still ended up dropping classes. I planned on taking summer classes so I could catch up. 1 of the courses which I just finished was just a fun class nothing related to my major and taking a calculus 3 course which isn‚Äôt going terribly. However I haven‚Äôt had a break from classes since my freshman year summer . I found out I start my second semester today technically and I broke down crying unsure if I can even make it through. The break I had was 3 days in between the semester and those were technically exam days.The class doesn‚Äôt have the best rating however if I don‚Äôt take it this semester I will have to take it this fall with 2 more difficult courses. Either way if I do decide to drop I will overthink and stress about the following semester and repeat my mistakes. Other than that the financial aid aspect is worrying me but I think I can handle that if I do decide to drop. However what really worries me is my mother. She doesn‚Äôt mind how long I take on my degree but doesn‚Äôt like me dropping classes. I don‚Äôt really understand but dropping those classes this winter made her kind of disappointed and I‚Äôm already not in a place where I can handle that. However cause of my decisions taking classes this summer, withdrawing those classes was kind of useless. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, I just want to graduate and be over with school but I don‚Äôt have much experience with jobs, internships, or clubs. It is kind of hard since I commute to school and can‚Äôt really attend late events and even if I could I‚Äôm just always so tired. My other major doesn‚Äôt really have any job prospect without doing an additional degree. My school is extremely rigorous and if I don‚Äôt put any effort failing is an option ,since 70% of the course is graded on just exams and there are 2 exams. What even more insane is that this course has a higher rated professor this summer than the fall but when one is rated 2.9 and the other 2.3 are the prospect really great. The class is not transferable and required so I will have to suffer through it to graduate.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1llodun/i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_need_some_advice/","1751011646.0","college","Tiredcat640"

"Too young for the college experience","I‚Äôm 19f. I started college at 16. I was born in the U.S. but raised abroad and returned here alone for school. My first year was rough adjusting to a new country, but sophomore year got better. I made some friends and started enjoying myself more.

Then junior year hit. I took on leadership roles, 18 credits a semester, and stopped going out as much. I got into a relationship but still made an effort to show up for my friends. As everyone turned 21, I slowly got left out. My hangout invites were ignored and people avoided certain conversations around me. I felt out of place, so I pulled back.

I also took a break from social media to focus on school. When the year ended, I realized I was burnt out and felt really alone. No one checked on me unless I reached out first.

My living situation made things worse. I signed a lease with random roommates. One was introverted, the other messy, and we didn‚Äôt get along. I gave up trying to connect.

The friendships I do have feel shallow. I went to a small school growing up so making friends came naturally. But I was one of the few Black people where I lived and never fully felt part of the culture. I hoped college in the U.S. would be different, but I don‚Äôt feel like I fit into Black spaces here either. I don‚Äôt get a lot of the cultural references and it makes me feel disconnected.

I still hang out with my ex because he‚Äôs the closest thing I have to a close friend, but that‚Äôs not ideal. My parents live abroad, so I‚Äôve had to navigate everything on my own.

Academically and career-wise, I‚Äôm doing good. But it‚Äôs hard to enjoy any of it without a real community. I‚Äôve worked hard to become more open and social, but I have fewer people around than ever.

Most of my friends have graduated. My peers are turning 21 and I‚Äôm scared of being left behind. I even considered getting a fake just to see what that social life is like, but I don‚Äôt want to risk my future for that.

I‚Äôm getting a car soon and moving into a new apartment. These should be exciting changes, but it‚Äôs hard to enjoy them when I feel so isolated. I have so many interests but no one to share them with. People don‚Äôt really reach out to me unless they‚Äôre trying to flirt, so I feel like I‚Äôm bothering people when I start conversations.

"My summer is miserable, help needed.","Hi, hope everybody's doing well.

I finished my GCSEs three weeks ago, and since I had to do 7 subjects within a year (I am an international student with no prior experience receiving secondary education in the UK which made it even harder for me) I naturally wanted to take a break during the summer holidays. I literally was studying insane amounts every day--I can't even remember a single day off I took last year. Thanks to this relentless grind, I scored 9s in every test, every quiz I took in school. However, quite obviously, I was so burnt out by mid-June. This was especially true bc last year was my first time living abroad away from my parents. So I was defo ecstatic to return home and finally enjoy life.

But guess what my parents decided to hit me with? 2hrs of AS content lesson 6 days a week. Plus they expect me to study 8 hrs every day. According to them those hours consist of: 2hrs lesson + 2hrs ucat practice + 2hrs reading + 2hrs tutor hw. Simply unrealistic!

And when I told them that this was too much, they told me that people my age were studying all day without even getting sufficient sleep. I swear I told my mum I just want to study 4hrs each day, but she started shouting, saying that a high schooler just mustn‚Äôt take on that type of complacent attitude.I told my parents I really needed this summer break to wind down in order to prevent burnout next year, hoping for some sympathy from them. But what I heard from them was: ‚ÄúEven though you take the summer off, things won‚Äôt be that different next year. And you don‚Äôt want people that studied hard over the summer to be better than you, do you?‚Äù

Whenever I look at my friends being carefree and enjoying their summer, I have to hold myself from bursting into tears. Studying has become a dreadful chore from something I genuinely had a passion for. And because I need to juggle SO MUCH all at once, I truly cannot focus on one task and I ACTIVELY FEEL my productivity declining.

It's not that I don't want to study or prepare for my future during the holidays. My goal was to immerse myself into dentistry (what I wanna do in uni) and read a lot of related books and articles. Perhaps do some work experience, and lightly skim over A-level content. I wanted to focus less on academics and genuinely have fun for once! But what I have to do right now is defo far away from what I envisioned. I mean, how am I even supposed to maintain my sanity with so much homework and pressure? Even when I asked my parents to reduce lessons they said they already paid the tutor so can't get a refund, and I was being too weak.

What can I do?? My life is miserable, I'm getting nothing done, and I hate how my summer is ticking past filled with rotten time. Genuinely, any advice would be appreciated.

"RS Advice. I‚Äôm too ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù","Hey. I‚Äôm ngl this post is going to be all over the place as i‚Äôm writing this while i‚Äôm on a walk and have to pay around my surroundings. 

Background info: Okay so me and my gf (both 18) began dating in september 2024 and already graduated may 2025. The issue is , she‚Äôs friends (or was) with this guy (we‚Äôll call John) she‚Äôs known since freshman year. See , this whole issue started before we took an ap calc test in April , when john had walked up to me and told me ‚ÄúAye your girl has been looking at me a lot‚Äù and since him and i are friends, I just made up some bs response but after, I messaged my gf. She ended up sending multiple messages saying how she just zoned out and how the seating arrangement makes it so that they look at each other when they look up. I believe her because I remember last year, she would zone out a lot and stare at me or others for a while. During lunch, I didn‚Äôt really mention it until we got to our study hour/period and I had asked to see the messages they had. I almost cried reading them while in class, as her messages seemed more engaging than the ones with ours. She had used more emojis, showed larger responses (instead of crying emojis like she just does with me when i tell her a story) and she has a custom emoji that‚Äôs popping its head out of a cardboard box. It‚Äôs meant to be cute, and she used it with him. All of that really almost made me tear down as the way she messaged him, was the way she messaged me while we were still talking, and it felt like I was seeing the person i fell in love with, talk to someone else that way (if that makes sense). I didn‚Äôt do much after this. Just handed her the phone back but after school ended and we got home, we talked about it again. She told me she doesn‚Äôt want me to worry, she apologized and she also blocked him. Unfortunately, I decided to make it seem like it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal so I told her ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to as summer is about to start and it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôll see our classmates again‚Äù. This made her end up unblocking him and like I said, they continued to message more. So after this, they would talk more and on this Wednesday, he came up to me and told me ‚ÄúYour girl made me feel bad today because she asked me to get her a piece of paper and I said that she could get it herself‚Äù ‚Ä¶ after that, I got irritated with her. I told her why it was so easy for her to go back on her word ‚Äúnot talking to him and keeping him blocked‚Äù so this turned into an argument (she wasn‚Äôt arguing, it was her apologizing but she still didn‚Äôt block him. She actually blocked him after she asked him for help for a math test and I found out (by him) and that was the final time they talked. FYI I had no idea she blocked him until a week later when we were using each other‚Äôs phones as we didn‚Äôt have a lecture for AP lit. I decided to snoop around and found out that she was still talking to him and I told her ‚Äúyou said you wouldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore‚Äù she started saying that she didn‚Äôt but the messages were RIGHT in front of me so I couldn‚Äôt believe her at all. After that, I just gave her back the phone and I was quiet the entire time. Trying not to cry. I wanted to break up with her at that moment because she had gone back on her promise each time and did exactly the opposite of what she wanted to. I started writing on my notes app so that after class I could show it to her and break up and that‚Äôs exactly what I did. We didn‚Äôt break up as we sorta talked things out but she showed me that he indeed was blocked for over a week (and at first I didn‚Äôt believe she would keep him blocked but a few weeks later I checked his contact and he was still blocked). Oh I just remembered this, but this guy had an ex that he still talks about til this day but he‚Äôs honestly so weird talking to my girl like that but not with any of his friends. He‚Äôs so dry with them yet he isn‚Äôt with my girl. Not only that, he told her ‚Äúyou make these classes so much fun‚Äù even though he has classes with all his friends AND sits with them. He even has read receipts off for multiple people but not my girlfriend. Another thing is, we had a big test for one of our AP classes for december as it was finals and the teacher wanted it to be 2 at a table (as it‚Äôs a small amount of students in that class) and I was sitting in the corner waiting for my gf to arrive. She did but she ended up sitting next to HIM. Later that day, she also told me that they were both talking but she didn‚Äôt want to tell me what it was so I had to force it out of her and it wasn‚Äôt anything bad, it was just something she did she was embarrassed of and that‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt want me to know. Another thing, she has this nickname she called him by (it was a freshman year class they had together and everyone did so idk if it‚Äôs right to be upset at this), one time after school, he waved bye at us but she thought he waved only at me so she yelled out ‚ÄúWow no Bye for me?‚Äù and thus other time during one of their convos, she asked what he had her as and she wasn‚Äôt happy with her contact so she said ‚Äúchange itüôÑput me as your fav best friend‚Äù‚Ä¶ funny considering that she‚Äôs against me having a girl bsf and i even blocked one of my female friends the moment she told me to AND i stuck to that promise. she‚Äôs still blocked. Alright so back to the main story, As we were in the library taking one of our AP exams, they sat next to each other while i sat a row behind them (seated by last names) so halfway through the test, I noticed that he had given up and he would turn to the side and smile at my gf and i couldn‚Äôt see what she was doing but I was certain she smiled back. I got pissed but I couldn‚Äôt do anything and then I saw that he was writing to her on the calculator and that made me even more mad. After the test, I just left her and went to class but I decided to come back to her coz she was waiting for me and wanted to talk. I told her how I saw her talking to him and all that and she denied it. I told her ‚ÄúWant me to ask him?‚Äù and she said yes. I asked him on imessage and she said ‚Äúyea your girl told me that you‚Äôre fine with me talking to her (he misread it coz she wrote to him on the palm of her hand) and that you think she‚Äôs cheating on you‚Äù. when I read that to her she smiled to hide the awkwardness I guess and I asked her why she had lied to me and I forgot what she said but I was pissed and basically started calling her a cheater. After that, she started crying and saying how she‚Äôs not a cheater and I told her to just reverse the roles and she said yea she wouldn‚Äôt be happy but I wouldn‚Äôt be a cheater. I told her she had lied to me and still engaged in a convo with him even tho she said she wouldn‚Äôt and she broke her promise multiple times. After this, she never talked to him again and I do remember before we graduated, we were taking pics for our ceremony and we were with a few friends. He walked up to us and he was looking at her a bit but she pretended to be on a phone call so he wouldn‚Äôt talk to her. 


Main thing:
Okay so after all of that background info, I‚Äôm writing this because even though it‚Äôs been months, I had a dream about it last night. It continues to haunt me and I don‚Äôt know what to do. The dream was that during one of our experiments for bio, the teacher assigned both of them to go take this bottle filled with soil and put it in the science room we have. What should have taken like 20 seconds turned into forever and they never came back. Worst part was, I could hear them talking and laughing. That was the entire dream (thankfully) but I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to tell her because last time we talked about this was about 2 months ago and I thought and she thought that we were past this. I know she would never cheat on me. She was the one to catch feelings first and she‚Äôs always reassured me with everything. I‚Äôve gone through her phone and she‚Äôs never done anything like that and she‚Äôs defended me from her friends multiple times. on top of that, her best friend likes me as well and so does her brother. I‚Äôm just worried and don‚Äôt know what I should do now cuz of this dream. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1lp9qqc/rs_advice_im_too_insecure/","1751395301.0","highschool","the-amari"
"High School Rivalry between two girls who barely spoke to each other","I‚Äôm a Grade 9 student, and there‚Äôs this Grade 11 girl at my school who **I‚Äôve spoken to through a friend but we're not close** or talk to each other, but we‚Äôve noticed each other *a lot*. It‚Äôs like this silent cold rivalry that never gets acknowledged, but always shows up in the background of our lives.

She‚Äôs really stylish and social, always smiling, always surrounded by people. I‚Äôm more focused on school and achievements, but we both seem to compete in the *vibe* department; outfits, hair, presence. Her favorite color is purple. Mine is pink. Somehow, we both lean into those colors and almost compete on who styles it better.

She sometimes does things after I do them‚Äîlike a certain hairstyle I wore regularly, she wore something similar soon after. Little details like crochet, bows, glasses, themed outfits. She‚Äôs not *exactly* copying me... but it feels like she mirrors things and adds her own spin. Enough that it‚Äôs noticeable. Enough that it messes with me.

Back when I was in 8th grade and she was in 10th grade, she used to stare at me a lot. I actually made a ‚Äúreport‚Äù about it in my notes because it was stressing me out. It‚Äôs not even that I hate her‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt know what her intentions are. We don‚Äôt talk. We‚Äôve never talked. But when I see her near my building or wearing a style I used to wear, something in me gets tense.

Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking. Maybe it‚Äôs all in my head. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt care at all. But when I walk past her, I still go:

‚ÄúUgh. There‚Äôs Zhenzhen again. >:(‚Äù

(Not her real name btw, I call her that like a code name.)

I‚Äôve even started writing fictionalized logbook-style posts about our indirect interactions. I feel like it helps me release the weird feelings without starting drama. But idk if I‚Äôm being too obsessed or if this is a normal thing to go through.

Has anyone else had this kind of one-sided rivalry before?","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1lp3u80/high_school_rivalry_between_two_girls_who_barely/","1751381906.0","highschool","MessyMellow"
"Failed my physics regents. Feel like a failure.","My parents consoled me since they're the best so luckily I'm more calm now. But I was so distraught when I saw my score... 64. For context, I have done extremely well in physics all year. The lowest score I've gotten on a test was a 72. My teacher was great too. 

I could have studied harder, that's the only reason there is to it why I didn't do well. I didn't prepare enough. But the thing is, I couldn't. I literally couldn't. Leading up to the test I was down with a severe sinus infection. My mom even took me to the hospital the day right before the exam. I don't even know how I managed to drag myself to school the next day and take the exam with the medications and illness. I was so dizzy during the exam and the mask I was wearing was making it hard to breathe. I have never failed a regents before. The lowest I have ever gotten is a 70. 

I am very thankful that I can retake it, though. I don‚Äôt think retake dates have come out yet, but I will double down hard and study. I am sure I will be able to kill it in my second attempt.

"Can I turn things around - 35","I am 35 almost 36. I have had to apply for disability benefits this year and its been over 10 years since I last took time off for my mental health. But my 20s were exceptionally difficult I dealt with SA, abuse, my Dad being killed and more. I just survived as best I could.  

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD and was diagnosed with CPTSD a couple of years ago. 

I did go and get a degree after my Dad was killed back in 2017, I went to college, did an access course and went on and got a foundation degree but jobs in my field have been hard to get and I ended up burning out spectacularly the last two years and ended up having a complete breakdown (I was also dealing with nerve pain for 9 months which didn't help).

I live in a rough-ish area in the UK. I dont own my home and rent is stupidly high if I wanted to move. 

Id love a job in nature or something very low stimulus like working with computers alone but I don't have qualifications for that. 

I hope there is a future for me. I worry things are hopeless. I  don't feel 35, it is like I am still trying to catch up mentally as I also grieve all the trauma and lost years to survival mode.

I wish I was more responsible with my money when I did have a job so I could of paid for it but having a lot of money for the first time 17-18 I just wanted to buy clothes makeup etc so I take accountability for my poor spending habits. I spent all my savings I don‚Äôt have a credit card yet but hoping soon when I get a job that‚Äôs the first thing I will do.  I don‚Äôt really have friends I don‚Äôt go out to often unless it‚Äôs with my one friend that wants to hang out with me every now and then. I have been unemployed for about a year now and I feel hopeless behind broke and a dissapoiment. I‚Äôm severely depressed I feel myself spiraling every single day it just gets worse and worse.

I‚Äôve made really bad decisions my whole teenage years especially 17-19. A lot of them is due to alcohol and trauma I find myself self sabotaging a lot of my relationships I feel like no guy will ever want to marry me or be in a relationship with me. I was super hypersexual 17-19 and I regret it so much I regret letting guys touch me. I was assaulted multiple times while drinking I‚Äôve made stupid decions while drunk and I hate that I started drinking so young.

The only thing that keeps me going right now is knowing that I ship of to bootcamp for the military in a few months and that gives me hope that my life will truly turn around. How do I fully let go of my traumatic past and the horrible things I‚Äôve said and done sometimes i think I‚Äôm over it then something or someone triggers it then boom I‚Äôm spiraling all over again it‚Äôs like a loop of sadness.

My mom is verbally abusive my sister also doesn‚Äôt really care it feels like everyone comes to me about their problems but it when it‚Äôs me the effort I put into them is never reciprocated and not feeling understood is the worst feeling ever.

"I lost my job 8 months ago, and it‚Äôs been a painful but eye-opening journey.","

Hi everyone,
I just want to share what I‚Äôve been going through over the past 8 months since losing my first job on September .

I was terminated by my team leader. From day one, she never seemed happy with my work. Even for small mistakes, she'd yell at me. One day I fell asleep at my desk‚Äînot because I was lazy, but because I had a fever and was shivering. She noted that, and later used it against me. My performance dropped a bit, and instead of helping, she started collecting points to target me. She used to isolate me from the team, made me sit separately, and eventually told me I wasn‚Äôt participating enough. Then, without real warning, HR called me in and fired me. Just like that, I was out. That day I cried in front of HR, but I left smiling‚Äîbecause I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know I was terminated.

I didn't even tell my parents. I was too afraid of what they‚Äôd think. For days, I cried alone in my PG. I started applying for jobs and gave interviews, but didn‚Äôt get selected. Eventually, I told my parents I lost the job due to ""project change"" and they simply said, ‚ÄúCome home, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù That support meant everything.

Later, I got two job offers‚Äîone from Genpact and one from a Noida company. But Genpact asked for an experience letter, and since I was terminated, I didn‚Äôt have it. They revoked the offer. The Noida job wanted an immediate joiner, and I couldn‚Äôt make it in time. Lost both.

Still, I didn‚Äôt give up. I began upgrading my skills and continued applying. I reached out to my previous company again for an experience letter, but they only gave a termination letter, which was of no use. I started looking at fresher roles in HR, sales, and operations. I cleaned up my LinkedIn, Naukri, and started cold-emailing. Slowly, calls started coming in. I even got an interview at Optum, but wasn‚Äôt selected.

Due to termination, I couldn‚Äôt obtain an experience letter despite multiple requests. Most MNCs ask for it, and I‚Äôm unsure how to apply without this document. If you have any suggestions or guidance, I‚Äôd truly appreciate your help. 

During this time, I realized skills and the right network are everything in 2025. A few work friends turned out to be huge supporters‚Äîthey kept pushing me to keep applying and never give up. And my parents? They reminded me how unstable corporate life is and encouraged me to prepare for government exams too. So now, I‚Äôm doing both.

Then I got another job offer from Cognizant. But again, the lack of experience letter became a hurdle. They needed my old team lead‚Äôs email for verification. When I messaged her politely, she refused to help. Didn‚Äôt even share HR contact. I lost the opportunity again.

It‚Äôs exhausting to keep going in this job market. So please‚Äîif you're a manager, be kind to your employees. Everyone is fighting a battle you can‚Äôt see.

Thanks for reading this long post. I know I‚Äôll find my path soon. I‚Äôm thankful to God, and this journey has made me stronger. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lqy8vb/i_lost_my_job_8_months_ago_and_its_been_a_painful/","1751570194.0","Adulting","Level-Positive7098"

I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong because I always reach out to people, and while I would have some response, it never sticks. For one reason or another, almost every friend I've met has either left or we have just fizzled out. Me and a friend decided to stop talking last year and because of this I distanced myself from our mutual friends (I realized after that most of my friends were her friends, but not my friends). I made some a new friend this semester, but no matter how much I reach out to her, she never responses. The same thing happened with my older friends.

I really want to leave college with atleast some solid friends (3-5?) that I can continue to talk with and I don't think that amount is large. I'd appreciate some help on what to do as I've already followed the typical advice-- joining new clubs, going to new places, inviting people I'm not close with to hang out. I

kinda hate myself for being like this and absolutely hate when I try over and over to reach out to people but no one replies :( This is me ranting, but I reached out to alumni and everyone raved about their friends and how their connections really stuck with them-- but I have no one that I'd even think of taking grad pics with.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lqootq/my_friends_never_last_and_i_need_help/","1751546788.0","CollegeRant","eithercryorpanic"

"I may have screwed up a major opportunity and I'm terrified (switching majors)","For context, I'm a 6th-semester Ivy student who was prior to yesterday double-majoring in neuroscience and English. Welp, I dropped my neuroscience concentration - sort of impulsively, but it may have been a long time coming - because I realized/admitted I didn't like it enough to tolerate a PhD/career in it. In studying neuro, I had intended to complete a PhD and attempt to break into pharma somewhere down the line. English, however - I couldn't be more obsessed with it (and have been since childhood), and (if all goes well) I'll be completing an undergraduate thesis and mayyybe a PhD in English (I genuinely really want to, but if it's either academia, the prospects for which are pretty abysmal right now, or being overqualified for jobs, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Still might do it, though lol). Thing is, I'll have accumulated about $130k worth of student loan debt upon graduating, and my parents cosigned my loans. I'm actually scared out of my wits that I'll be delinquent and they'll have to bear responsibility. Also, I'm not sure if I can re-add my neuroscience concentration at this point - I'm only halfway through its requirements either way - or if I even want to.

Alright fine well that dream is gone and my dad wanted me to stay close anyway so I decided to just go to an average state school but even when I felt like I was settling, they gave me a slap on the face with the 20k tuition which is insane for being in-state. I feel so guilty for my parents who agreed to help me pay even though they were struggling too especially with my dads unemployment but even more so depressed because it feels like all my efforts for the past years have been in vain. What‚Äôs even funnier is that my friends who barely tried in school are paying less than me just because they signed up for a program which I wasn‚Äôt aware of and could‚Äôve applied for, which would‚Äôve payed for 10k of my tuition. If their mom hadn‚Äôt forced them to apply the day of the deadline then they wouldn‚Äôt have known either. At this point what was the point of my hard workin high school? Why did I work my ass off in school when I could‚Äôve applied for a single program and be in a better standing than I am now? I feel so miserable right now and I can‚Äôt even find a job, it‚Äôs hard again because of the location. Life at home with my dad has always been cold but even more so recently. I‚Äôm tired, I keep missing opportunities and I can‚Äôt see light.

"Going back to college after three years in the work force","I tried college right out of high school (which was in the middle of the Covid pandemic) and failed miserably. My mental health went down the drain and I failed every class. I dropped out, but before I did, I was placed on Academic Probation which I reassumed when I enrolled again at the same college for the fall semester. I enrolled in a full course load containing four classes. My advisor is encouraging me to drop down to two classes so I can gradually work my way back in. Also, if I fail these four classes again, I will be placed on Academic Suspension and forced to sit out for a semester. I already know what I‚Äôm probably going to do, which is going down to two classes, but I could use some outside advice.

"Telling my AP that I want to change my major...","Previously a Architectural Engineering Major (I chose this major because my dad told me to pick a major that would pay me 65000+, and it was also what I was mildly interested in) going to a community college, I want to change to Psychology. I hated AE for 2 years (been going for 3) and am supposed to transfer to another college next semester. My parents also want me to apply for an intership this summer. Truth is, I loved Psychology (interest started in Middle School, peaked in Highschool) and want to get a connected degree (Human Services to Psychology). I also have ADHD, so it's harder to concentrate and complete assignments on time (sometimes I need reread a page dozens of times to understand it). I also noticed that I was so interested in it that I didn't burn out during the middle of the semester like I usually do and managed to hold until the last two weeks where I slowed down (still passed). 

My APs hate each other and only stay together for my younger brothers (youngest is 10). My AF is emotional distant with my mom (also his mother treated my mom badly and he did nothing). My AM hates that my father (who works 7 days a week 8-10 hours) doesn't do considerate things (washing dishes, loading dishwasher, etc.).

My AF is already mad that I'm taking longer than the ""needed"" years (taking 5 years instead of 4) to finish my study (they don't understand that credits are what counts the most). My AM mentioned a few times that once I graduate, to get an apartment and take her away from my AF. Though, she (probably calmed down after seeing the rent prices) hasn't mentioned it for months. 

For reference, my mental health got so bad last year (summer through fall semester), that I got suicidal to runaway to deciding to stay after speaking to a counselor (college provides mental health service). There's also finances to consider. My father constantly asked if I applied for a loan (which I have not done yet). I was planning to pay it through, semester tuition is 2000-2500 for full-time students. There is also the fact that they want me to take 4 classes a semester, something I now understand that I really can't manage, 3 is my max. But they refuse to learn about or see the symptoms of ADHD.

I know I can't delay this much longer and need to tell them. My original plan was to email or text them this information while I was at work or something. Since I've been keeping this to myself, my anxiety and stress level is through the roof. Any advice appreciated.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1ll4eae/telling_my_ap_that_i_want_to_change_my_major/","1750954818.0","CollegeRant","East_Measurement_294"
"Feeling socially unfulfilled","I‚Äôm going into my third year of college this upcoming fall and it feels so surreal that it went by so fast, yet I feel like I‚Äôve achieved next to nothing in terms of social activity. I‚Äôm a generally introverted person and I have a good amount of people I would call friends, but I‚Äôm not the kind of person who typically initiates or hangs out with people very often. I hate myself for feeling like I‚Äôm wasting some of the most fun years of my life and I want to be better this year. I frequent a handful of clubs but nothing meaningful really came from it last year, and I want to be better. The problem lies in that I don‚Äôt think I struggle socially if I‚Äôm comfortable but I can‚Äôt see myself starting conversations and making connections out of insecurity and shyness. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm trying to work on because I feel like I can rarely make new connections that actually last more than a brief moment. I would appreciate any advice if anyone has some and thanks for listening to me rant for a little bit.

"It‚Äôs probably my fault but I just needed to see if anyone else has been here.","Not sure what to say really but I just wanted some outside opinions because I‚Äôm going crazy and it‚Äôs only like 2 months into dealing with this community college.

So this is my first year and first semester right now, before this I had no experience with college let alone the (very) shitty website this school provides and expects us all to use for EVERYTHING from scheduling classes to communicating with advisors. Literally anything I try to do in person is met with ‚ÄúYou have to go to the website and do XYZ‚Äù which has been really frustrating because the website is glitchy, inefficient, and confusing to navigate. Anyways since it‚Äôs my first experience with college in general I relied heavily on my advisor to help me plan and schedule my classes, and I made him very aware that I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do or how to do it considering the only help I have in my life are people who went to college over thirty years ago and don‚Äôt understand the technology aspect. He decided that based on that information he was gonna place me into accelerated classes that only run for 6 weeks and are incredibly difficult. Me, a freshman student. On top of that they weren‚Äôt even general education classes like English or math, they‚Äôre difficult and essential classes.

At that point in time I hadn‚Äôt realized the difficulty level involved in those accelerated classes, I assumed ‚ÄúOh, well they ARE intro classes so they probably won‚Äôt be that difficult hence the accelerated option being chosen for me‚Äù Fast forward to now and the classes are wrapping up and I feel like I got screwed over immensely and I‚Äôm very frustrated. For example my forensics class had a test every two weeks, however each test was 80 questions long and covered at least 7 chapters. I didn‚Äôt do well on a single one, the highest score I received was 71%. This was on top of multiple weekly assignments, however that part was totally fine and I did very well on.

I just don‚Äôt understand how my advisor expected me to do this?? Or anyone for that matter unless they‚Äôre just retaking the class. I‚Äôm confused and upset. Can I not truly not rely on anyone to do their job or help me navigate this difficult process that my future relies on? Like why would my advisor hear the info about me and decide that‚Äôs the best course? Also for others in accelerated classes do your professors also give you 3 or more separate tests that consist of at least 80 questions each with only two weeks in between? Or is that a fucking lot because it sure feels like it??

I just needed to vent and hear some other opinions because I can‚Äôt keep bottling it up like this.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1ljsjqd/its_probably_my_fault_but_i_just_needed_to_see_if/","1750813725.0","CollegeRant","haleyglover_"
"how do I distinguish my academic failures from my own personal self worth?","I've posted here before about constantly failing my classes or even training programs, and im wondering how do you guys cope with failing? the reason why I ask this is because,

I genuinely can't see myself as not being an utter failure when I cant pass quizzes, or don't understand the assignments. I even argued with my therapist about it cause, yes im grateful for the job stability I have now, got my license finally after years of trying, yet I still feel like a massive loser because every failure along the way has been marked onto me and I cant Help but be reminded of them all whenever I attempt college. I was in college for 4 years and never made it to the second semester of my program cause I couldnt get a B in most of the classes, so I tried only doing 1 class and I still failed, I tried a workforce program in my college and failed that as well.

"Please be blunt with me‚Äì do I have a shot at getting into a good graduate school program? (LONG post)","I'd ask r/college, but they delete everything when I talk about my mental health. Fair warning for mentions of suicide, drugs, and abuse. I won't be going into too much detail, because that's gruesome.

So, when I hit high school, my mom turned to drugs which made her violent and abusive (to the point I had to worry about my life). This screwed over my high school GPA, which was a 2.4 (weighted).

So I went to community college, broke and unprepared, because I needed to get out of that abusive household. But because I was so unprepared, I failed all of my classes my first semester. I was also hospitalized for mental health reasons that semester, which caused me to give up and fail.

I retook all of my classes next semester and ended up getting around a 3.2~ish? So, not bad. Nothing below a B-. I did finish this semester, but around April after my finals, I attempted suicide. I lived (duh), but I never told anyone until a year later and I never went to the hospital for it, so nobody knew. All of my credits taken so far have been for either my biology major or general education. Nothing related to my current major.

I continued through online college, and decided to transfer when I had around a 3.0. Really not great, but not that bad. I transferred to a university that wasn't my first choice, but it was better than nothing. I was an animation major (I had no clue what I was doing, and I really thought an animation degree from a mediocre Midwest university would get me somewhere), so a lot of my credits from here were related to animation.

That year (2023/2024) I got hospitalized twice (both times during finals) for mental health reasons. I got a 3.889, though!

I decided to come back home to online college to finish up my associate's degree I never finished. I retook a class I initially failed (it was during my previous online period) because it was just a hard ass class, but I retook it and got a C. Hardest class I've ever taken and it was a level 200 gen-ed run by a guy who was disappointed his life never went the direction he wanted it to go. Anyways. I also got a good grade in my other class and bumped my GPA up to a 3.208.

Got my associate's degree now, finished last December and decided to take the spring semester off to save money for another school I wanted to transfer to. During the summer and fall of that year, I was hospitalized twice. During the fall and the winter of that year, I ""attempted suicide"" twice (I wasn't faking, I just don't know what else to call it and I don't want to get into details). Making three attempts in total. I was diagnosed with bipolar II after my third attempt (I also got diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD previously, but these didn't affect me as much).

I talk about all of this even though it's really hard for me because I believe it's essential to my story and who I am. I don't know how much I can talk about on college applications, which absolutely sucks. If I go too into detail, I'm seen as a burden and asking for pity. But that's not what I'm doing and I know for a fact I'm not a burden.

Anyways, today I have a combined 3.495 GPA, and I'm transferring to a local university much closer to my dad, that way I have support if something bad happens. But, with medications and being properly diagnosed, my hopes are high. I'm currently going to aim for a 3.9/4.0 (although as long as I have a 3.2+, I'll be okay, as that's the requirement for completion of the honors program). And the reason I'm so positive I might be able to aim this high is because if I can get a 3.5 unmedicated (with bipolar disorder, I need to stress, because that is a BITCH to live with undiagnosed) and unsupported, I think I can get even higher with proper medication and proper support.

I'm now going into marketing (I'm positive I'll stay with my major this time, because I told myself if I don't like it that's too bad), and I'm actually really excited for my classes. So, my first goal is to get a 3.9/4.0 (although I won't beat myself up if I don't get this!), and graduate with a couple internships under my belt. Next, I plan on working for a couple of years (needed for an MBA) while studying for my GMAT (my ideal score is 700+, again, won't beat myself up if I don't get this), and after my MBA and a couple of years with that, I want to get my doctorate and eventually become a professor. I'd also ideally maybe work with nonprofits.

Anyways, now that that spiel is out of the way, let's say these for a couple of examples: I get my ideal GPA of a 3.9, and I get a 730 on my GMAT exam (because I am going to study like a sonofabitch for it), I got good essays (maybe related to my personal experience, maybe not), I explain in my application that I had medical issues preventing me from reaching my full potential. I am also a female coming from an impoverished area, with parents who are both disabled. I am also first-gen, female, and white. I got good extracurriculars under my belt (including working since I was 16), as well as a couple of years (lets say two as the minimum) of relevant work.

I'm fine with getting into a small, nameless school for my MBA (if I choose that as my master's instead of something else). But that's not what I want. I want something that'll impress people. If I get the statistics I previously mentioned, I'll be applying to M7s. I do not expect to get into these M7s, but I'll beat myself up if I don't apply. More realistically, I'll be applying to T25s, preferably the University of Michigan. I'm looking for a fully covered tuition, or at least, half covered.

Be honest and blunt with me, what do I say on my applications, and what are my chances?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1li37jg/please_be_blunt_with_me_do_i_have_a_shot_at/","1750639070.0","CollegeRant","None"
"College has been nothing but pain","First off, I want to say that I'm in community college, so maybe that's why I'm experiencing the issues I‚Äôm about to vent about in this post. I'm a second-year student and will soon transfer to a four-year university. My experience with college has been horrible, and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one because no one else I talk to seems to be having the same experience.

Let‚Äôs start with the classes.

1. The professors suck. They don‚Äôt seem to care about us or the course itself. It feels like they just show up to collect a paycheck. Most of them teach by reading off crappy PowerPoints ‚Äî the kind they could‚Äôve just uploaded online ‚Äî but instead, they waste an hour reading them out loud and call it a day. Then they assign work that‚Äôs almost completely unrelated to the slides. I honestly wish I could get paid thousands of dollars just to read slides. Nice to know where my tuition money is going.


2. The students are assholes. I‚Äôve never met so many rude or fake people in one place. There are basically two types: people who don‚Äôt want anything to do with you, and people who just want to use you ‚Äî either for favors or something else. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone genuine. It‚Äôs also really hard to make new friends. The clubs at my school are worthless, and the people who do go to them are already in tight friend groups. I‚Äôve been to three different clubs ‚Äî big ones, like the gaming club and anime club ‚Äî and the average attendance is like four or five people. So I gave up. At this point, I‚Äôm more isolated than a prisoner.


3. College takes up so much time, and time is money  and I‚Äôm broke. To top it off, I‚Äôm not even sure I want to continue with my major. Thanks to some terrible teachers, I‚Äôve come to hate accounting, which is kind of ironic since it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm studying.



So to recap: the teaching sucks, the social life is nonexistent, and I‚Äôve grown to hate my major. Why am I even doing this?

I‚Äôm halfway through, so now I just feel obligated to keep going. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, because everyone else ‚Äî even people at my school ‚Äî don‚Äôt seem to have these issues. I didn‚Äôt expect college to be perfect, but the fact that I can honestly say I had better education in high school is wild.


TL;DR: The education sucks, the social life really sucks, and college is making me more miserable than I‚Äôve ever been.

"My parents make $0 and seeing other student's parents paying $200k+ for their tuition makes me sad","My parents are both disabled‚Äì the only reason they have a place to live is because our grandma lets us live at her house for almost completely free. But even before they became disabled, my dad was a roofer and my mom was a factory worker, so they weren't making anything spectacular.

My mom did have a small savings before she became disabled ($10k), which was a LOT to us, but she ended up blowing it all on drugs. That's the ""richest"" we've ever been.

I make more than my parents at $14/hr as a food clerk at Meijer. I do have a savings of $8.5k, currently. I am also in a lot of medical debt due to lots of psychiatric hospitalizations (maybe 7 or 8?). I currently have a collection marked as a derogatory on my credit score because I couldn't even afford $10/mo at the time it was given to me. (I completely forgot about this debt, and I have received nothing in the mail about it being in collections... I plan on calling them to see if I can resolve this, but I doubt it).

I went to community college to save money, but it ended up kind of screwing me over, as every university in the state doesn't offer free tuition towards transfer students (except for the University of Michigan, which is not only on the other side of the state, but I got screwed over because the dad I DO NOT LIVE WITH and get NO assistance from technically has assets over $120k, even though he makes $50k/yr). Grand Valley State did offer free tuition for transfers until last year. All these cool programs about free community college were not there when I graduated in 2021.

I have $15k in student loans (I'm in year four of college). Not great, not horrible. I'm saving my money so I'll be able to pay it off.

I'm awaiting to see if I won an $11,000 transfer student scholarship at my university.

Even with the full Pell grant, the full amount of loans, FSEOG grant, and scholarships and grants from the university and from outside scholarships, I still have to pay $5,000 out of pocket (hence why I'm awaiting to see if I won this scholarship). Good news is I'll get tuition reimbursement from Meijer, so this should go back in my pocket.

I just saw a post on r/FAFSA about a student who was a full blown millionare talking about his FAFSA. He proceeded to go into the comments and make insulting comments about poor families, as if it's our choice to be poor. This really hurt.

It also reminds me of the multiple times fellow students will come up to me asking ""what do your parents do?"" and I have to tell them every time that they're disabled and make literally nothing. People act shocked (albeit all of them have been supportive), but it makes me feel so out of place.

And I'm going to be real for a second, I am 100% envious of students who can afford to go to ivy leagues out of pocket and live in luxury apartments because of their parent's pockets. And sometimes seeing these people pisses me off, even when it shouldn't. I know better than to be angry, because it's good to see that somebody is succeeding in the world and has supportive parents, but at the same time, I can't really help it.

But mostly it just makes me feel really sad. I wish I grew up with more money. I wish my mom wasn't a drug addict. I wish my parents weren't disabled (for both their sake and mine). I feel so out of place sometimes.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lgldgx/my_parents_make_0_and_seeing_other_students/","1750471562.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Living home with my toxic dad","Hello guys. I'm currently a sophomore doing my summer classes. I recently withdrew from an intro to Philosophy course. To get straight to the point, basically I was super overwhelmed from the online class and simply the online class just didn't feel right to me so guys I thought withdrawing the course was good to save my GPA and that's what I did. I withdrew from the course. Fast forward, when I had this conversation with my dad that I withdrew from this course, he literally cursed me out and called me an a-hole for not asking for help and like he was so unhappy and so frustrated. Like I want a nice GPA even if it comes at a hard choice of withdrawing an online summer course like that. Withdrawing courses is not easy but I had to do it to save my GPA. Sorry if I sound like a neurotic kid but my GPA is 3.47 right now cumulative. I'm a chemistry major. A couple of things I didn't find right was that online courses are generally not suitable to me and the pace felt a bit too quick. I'm more of a slow learner when it comes to philosophy. I was simply overwhelmed with work guys. 

He cursed me out and made me feel so bad about myself, like yes dad I'm trying hard but sometimes I'm too overwhelmed to ask for help. HE LITERALLY SAID I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'M (MOSTLY) GETTING As and Bs IN MY OTHER COURSES!!! I EVEN TOLD HIM THAT BUT HE DISMISSED MY EFFORTS. For context, he pays the tuition of my university so he kind of has a right to intervene and ask me. That also pushes me to the halfway point always, should I move out and actually live my life I want in a college out of town but have to deal with not-so-healthy college foods and have to eat out at Chipotle or something to satisfy my hunger. I don't know man, he has been like this since when I was a young kid. But no hate to my dad, I love my dad so much and I will continue to love him but at the same time, man you gotta acknowledge my efforts. Anyway guys, what can I do in this situation guys? I am typing this at night so I may not be able to reply to you instantly but I might reply in the morning. 

  
TL;DR: My dad called me an a-hole and cursed me out and didn't acknowledge my mental health at all, I even communicated my efforts and yeah sometimes I got overwhelmed. I even communicated my efforts but he dismissed those efforts and even threatened me that if I continue down this road, expect me to call you (aka me) an even worse curse word.

"I ruined my GPA in a span of six weeks","I can't believe it. I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I was one of the few people whose marks actually went up from high school to uni. I decided to (stupidly) take two accelerated, online, six-week summer courses that spanned from early May to about now. I knew I was burnt out by the end of April, but the only reason I took those courses was to not be viewed as ""an unproductive loser"" (because I didn't apply to a summer job, and I was discouraged to as well, by my parents) by my household. I think I failed both courses.

I don't know what happened to me. I felt so unmotivated and procrastinated a lot during them. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought of doing a withdrawal from both but I didn't, because I thought I could push through. Now it's a stain on my transcript forever. I think I failed both. One of those courses is related to my major (economics), an intermediate level one, and now I'm discouraged that maybe I should switch majors. Despite me getting A's in the introductory courses and having a genuine passion for the subject. I'm devastated. I think this will only further my depression. I don't even know what I can blame; my laziness or depression. I may not even have depression; I may be unknowingly just using it as an excuse to mask my laziness. My parents are consoling me but I feel ashamed of myself. It's a nightmare.

I have no one to blame by the way. The professors were good, and the tests were fair. I only have myself to blame.

I knew I'd mess up at something. It seemed too good to be true that I had a 3.7 in my first year, given I've had one struggle after another since like 2022 (mainly personal/mental issues). I thought something was finally looking up for my life. But I was wrong. I'm back to square one. When I graudated high school last year and started university I had pledged to myself that I'd do well, and that university would be a ""fresh start"" after the worst 4 years of my life which was high school.

"I was the crazy roommate back in 2023‚Äì it was horribly embarrassing and shameful","MASSIVE trigger warning for suicide.
I don't really know if this is a rant as much as it is ruminating about something terrible. I would talk about it on r/college, but that'd be a guaranteed post being taken down and/or ban. I guess I just need to open up about this.

So I was 20 and I lived with 18 years olds, we met on Facebook and decided to be roommates on-campus for 2023/2024. They seemed really cool.

We got along VERY well (in fact, my roommate had a crush on me, but of course I didn't initiate because I didn't want to date an 18 year old lmfao). We were very close friends.

Well, a couple months in, things started to sour a bit. One of our roommates was irritating everybody else. I had disagreements about how to do the chores (I don't even remember what it was about clearly), and I tried explaining this clearly quite a few times, they just never really got it (or they chose to ignore it).

They did quite a few things that pissed me off, and I do believe that they didn't like me because I disagreed with how to do chores and I was open about it. They were very messy roommates (got warned for their messiness right before I left, left shitty underwear on the counter, garbage everywhere, dirty dishes, used period pads in the shower...) and that irritated me. They expected me to pick up after them, basically.

They started being more and more cold to me as time went on. We started to dislike each other, two of my roommates started to gang up against me and my other roommate.

I'm very stressed out about my grades around this time, and I never told anybody, but I was deeply struggling with suicidal thoughts. When my roommates were gone, I would scream and curse to myself because of how stressed out I was (I was losing it, yes). My roommate did find a suicide note I left at one point, to which I just kind of... apologized to the best of my abilities, and I told her I was okay. She was actually pretty kind about it. She invited me to have tea and talk about fun stuff with her.

I was going crazy by this point. My thoughts made no sense and were very jumbled. I was barely stable in classes, but I did resemble a bit of sanity to the point people outside of my roommates thought I was normal.

I told my residence hall director what was going on. I was afraid to talk to my RA because I knew they'd want to have a group chat with my roommates, and I was afraid to confront them and be singled out even more. He just kind of sighed, made a little comment about not going to the RA, and he didn't really do much. He didn't take me seriously at all, obviously.

Time passes, and we eventually get into a big argument in the group chat. I don't remember about what other than chores and me feeling ganged up on. I was slamming doors and kicking stuff. Eventually, my roommate awkwardly comes into the bedroom and ignores me, and I guess I just kind of snapped. I muttered ""I can't do this anymore"" and grabbed all of my medication and went into the bathroom.

By this point, I took my phone and I called 988, because a small part of me recognized that I was not okay and I needed help. I ended up screaming and sobbing. I was minutes away from downing every pill I had and drinking a combination of all the chemicals I had around me. Fortunately, 988 called the police on me, and so did my roommates, because I think they suspected that something was deeply wrong. A roommate did knock on the door and ask if I was okay, to which I replied yes (I wasn't).

Of course, the police show up along with the person working at the front desk at the time, and I'm taken away to a cop car to the hospital where I was involuntarily admitted for about a week.

By this point, I thought I just had major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. I did have a suicide attempt about a year or two before this.

A week passes and I'm taken back to campus right as finals were about to happen. Great news, my residence hall director emailed me telling me there was an opening in the building, and there was another person seeking out a roommate because of their bad roommate situation. I did have to spend another night at my old dorm, and it was a little awkward, but it was calm. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about it.

Eventually, I did move out. It was awkward and silent between my roommates as I was packing up. My roommate did offer to help me pack very kindly. I refused the help, but I did thank her. And then I moved three floors down.

My new roommate was awesome. We did have a ""disagreement"" on how to do chores, in the sense that we had different ideas of what to do, but we came up with a scenario that worked for both of us very quickly and easily, they were very understanding and nice. We got along just fine for the rest of the year.

I did run into my roommates twice. One time, we ran into each other while I was leaving the dining hall. We smiled at each other and I opened the door for her, and she said thank you. Another time, my roommate left my stuff in a bag by my door that I forgot to pack with a note that said ""Have a great summer :)"", I emailed her thanking her and telling her to have a great summer back. And that was the last we heard from each other.

After this, I transferred back to my community college (partially out of embarrassment) and lived at home while I got my associate's degree (which I earned last December, and then I took the winter semester off). I attempted suicide two more times, and went to the hospital involuntarily three more times.

So, um... yeah, I was the crazy roommate. And I feel just horrible. I mean, really, really bad (as I should). I think I traumatized my freshman year roommates. I don't care how mean they were being towards me at the moment, what I did wasn't okay. But I didn't know what else to do. I was losing my mind.

And what breaks my heart even more is that they were so nice to me about it later. I did meet a friend of my roommate after that incident, and she told me that my roommate spoke about the incident and me poorly, but I really deserve that and I'm okay with that. I almost wish they weren't nice to me about it at all. I think they understood that I wasn't quite all there.

I think the only reason I wasn't academically dismissed is because I did tell my RHD I was struggling a couple of times, and my dad called the college and explained the situation/my mental health. I did have to talk to the student success center and keep visiting them. Trust me, I wouldn't have gone to college and gotten roommates if I knew my mental health was going to be that bad.

Later on (just about 6 months ago actually), I got diagnosed with bipolar II, not MDD. Which explains (but doesn't excuse) the crazy behavior. I'm finally properly medicated. I'm not even suicidal anymore, and I feel genuinely happy, even with the downsides in my life.

I'm returning to in-person college this fall. I am going to have my own personal bedroom, but three suitemates (couldn't afford a single bedroom), but please don't worry. If something bad happens, I only live 20 minutes away from my dad at this university and can stay with him, and I am much more prepared to tackle things this time due to being properly medicated.

So, um... yeah. I was the crazy roommate. And I hate it so much. I feel so guilty (like I should). I guess I just needed to talk about it and open up about it. I wish I could email my previous roommates and apologize, but I think it's better if I left it alone. Like I said, I guess I just need to open up about it. If you read this far, I appreciate it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfjc5m/i_was_the_crazy_roommate_back_in_2023_it_was/","1750360389.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Halfway done with college since last month and it's been a total shitshow","My college experience has been ruined by my shitty immigrant parents and mental illnesses. I knew the steps I needed to change but I just spiraled due to being scared and depressed and I blame myself for it

Firstly, I hate my parents a lot. My neurodivergence was a huge issue, but they made everything worse. They're Indian immigrant parents too by the way. They ruined the first 20 years of my life. They literally abused me a lot as a kid both physically and emotionally for the dumbest shit ever too, they just put pressure and expectations on me, they literally control and shelter me even at 20 and treat me like a fucking child and restrict me from freedom a normal teenager gets in the USA, and I'm pretty sure they only had my little brother and I so we take care of them when they're old or to see us as an extension of themselves. 

They got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis sometime in second to fourth grade, but didn't tell me until 7th grade just because I was too young. Hiding a diagnosis is one thing, but they constantly made me feel like a failure for those stuff and abused me. They KNEW the fucking reasons why I struggled with academics and social situations, had odd specific interests, struggled with attention span and comprehension, why I had to take special ed, why I had to take ABA therapy, why a doctor forced me on a gluten and dairy free diet in third grade and forced me to take some meds, and still fucking treated me like a failure and a bad kid. And until 11th grade, they absolutely REFUSED to get me a psychiatrist or meds. They don't understand my ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression at all and sometimes even downplay my struggles. 

Like they're overall shitty parents. They force me to adhere to Indian culture when I don't connect with it at all and also force Hinduism and some ridiculous superstitions on me when I am personally not religious and they believe you should blindly follow these stuff no matter what and take them very seriously. 

Both of them are narcissists, but my mom even more so because she has almost every textbook trait of a narcissist, so she is generally worse. 

I hate how they say they ""give us everything we want"" and even say they're more lenient than other parents when all they did was give a few toys and stuff for gaming we want and pay for college and expenses which is the fucking bare minimum. They even brag about the BARE bare minimum like giving birth, raising us, wiping our asses, food, clothes etc. 

They say we're the ones who are seeing them as villains and not communicating our feelings and assuming they'll say no, but it's straight bullshit. 

They don't give a shit about anything I like. In elementary school, I loved lego sets and after 5th grade, they stopped buying them just because that was the only thing I bought and they thought I was too old. Even for my 11th birthday with my OWN allowance and birthday money when I wanted to buy a $120 lego set, they didn't let me for that stupid reason. In high school, I was passionate about gaming and even wanted to go pro or make content, but even on summer break, they only let me play 1.5 hours on weekends. And even now in college they're controlling. Like last year when I picked apartment housing for sophomore year, they fucking made me screen share and made me put reqs as no beef, no drinking, no smoking. Im still forced to follow religion and culture blindly, they force me to go on vacations with them or dumb gatherings with family friends. Like I'm 20 for fucks sake and still treated like 12. 

They have high expectations and think anything below a 3.5 is a bad GPA and they say we're lucky they don't expect 4.0. 

They just use the ""give everything you want"" and ""we pay for college and everything"" lines as leverage to control us and later use it in the future. They literally made us study in breaks and only care about us being successful.

Secondly, I hate myself for having ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression. ADHD and Autism fucking ruined my life since childhood. Like I said, it made me struggle academically and socially, made me mentally immature and behind, and have weird interests.Those weird interests made it hard for me to connect with people my age that since middle school, I withdrew myself completely because people became more judgy. While they were into normal interests like sports, pop culture, and TV shows better for their age group, I was still into shows considered childish and toys and even that way in high school. 

My anxiety and depression started in 6th grade too. I was even delusional until 12th grade just every day wishing for some magic powers, which is stupid I know, but it happened and one of the reasons I ruined my life. I did read that child abuse affects amygdala and hippocampus, which increases risk of anxiety and depression, which is probably why I have those two. 

Because of my parents and mental illnesses, I literally missed out on 20 years of my life and experiences like friends, partying, sports, dating, sex, being popular, having a fake ID etc.. Combine that with my parents pressuring me to get out of comfort zone and shell all the,  making friendships and socializing feel draining, and not assimilating to US culture and teaching us how to be socially successful just made me avoid everything. 

It also doesn't help that everyone these days also says that being shy, having no friends, and not fitting in is okay when that's the reason why most of my generation sucks. 

Fast forward to now where I halfway finished college a month ago and it's been an absolute shitshow. I'm at ASU and ever since I stepped foot in it on day 1, my life became much worse. I was placed with outgoing roommates who love to party. That was when I hated myself for how I was and wanting to be introverted when I kept hiding. Like I remember even one hot girl liked me and I didn't believe it. 

After that semester, I wanted to party but I realized you have to be in a frat to party. I wasn't confident enough to rush and then missed out and said I would do it the first sem of sophomore year. Just being lonely and dwelling on the past so much made me more miserable and spiral more that my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 3.59 and just rot more. 

But I did NOTHING to improve myself and just waited and then it came and I got no bids from the houses I rushed. You'd think I'd improve myself this time, but I fell in a worse spiral and tanked my GPA  to a 3.46 instead, even skipped classes for a whole month, and even had a shitty diet and worked out less. Then 4th sem came and this time same shit. It sucked because I actually tried this time and was more social and cracked jokes and everyone was gassing me up and even in one of the other frats I knew 4 guys from freshman year and 3 of them had exec positions and even acknowledged my change, yet I didn't get in a SINGLE invite only event. It sucks because sophomore year is generally the last time to rush. I know I could've gotten in a bottom house and still can in junior year because they bid anyone, but I hate them because they're like 40 members at most and all rejects who only joined because they were rejected from actual frats just for the sake of being in one, but they're still irrelevant. 

I know most people go to bars instead of frat parties and frat parties are usually off campus, but I really wanted this shit since second semester of college to meet a lot of people quickly and be popular and that's what I based my whole identity on to get in those specific frats. Even though people still tell me I can make a few drinking buddies and a girl and even if people drift after college, it sucks ass at the moment not being in a frat, especially under 21. 

I literally vowed that if i get a bid, I'd start getting my shit together.And it does seem like many people who party are in the frats I just hated everyone in greek life since then and hated people in general. The decent frats are mostly people who have been ready since HIGH SCHOOL. Many of them are even PROUD of being exclusive, but I bet a lot of them never had to deal with neurodivergence or a shitty upbringing. It sucked how they straight up gassed me up and cut me early. I'd rather have been straight up INSULTED and beaten up and thrown out rather than whatever the fuck that was. I hope a day comes where I get to beat these people up because after this rejection from the frats when it was my last chance to rush, I don't have a chance at the most optimal college experience possible.

I don't wanna join a club or just talk to people in classes because clubs are for nerds and nothing like frats. And I DO wanna party which most of these losers online are against. That semester was the worst that I even failed a class and tanked to a 3.29. I hate being told to just make the best out of everything. I was too scared coming from abuse and being sheltered and neurodivergence into college and anxious to talk to people because they wouldn't like me. This frat shit was the only shit I wanted in college and I have no chance anymore. 

My life gets worse every year, but ever since I started college, it's been much worse. I just hate myself for my fucked up mind making me miss out on everything. 

I don't know if I'll ever have a college experience as I hoped. I fucking hate this place and can't wait to graduate. I'm just so bitter and resentful towards the people having what I have and towards the people who excluded me. I hate my parents for not knowing how to be good parents and not assimilating to US culture and learning how to be cool. I hate myself for constantly spiraling and blowing up the last chance at rush. Sure I can get some drinking buddies and a girl and most people go to bars when older, but it won't feel the same as being in a frat.

"I shouldve never listened to my sister and now idk how to twll her about my choice for community college","Hi. I am a recently graduated high school student who was persuaded into applying to UC Merced instead of going to CSU Chico. I was dead set on going to Chico and even excited to see a brand new part of California even if it meant leaving my family far away. My sister pushed me to the only UC I got accepted to because ‚ÄúUCs have better education compared to CSUs‚Äù So I withdrew from Chico and thought I wanted to go to Merced even though they didn‚Äôt have the major of my choice (rlly dumb ik) sooo I was like ‚ÄúI GUESS ill go because UCs are better and I‚Äôll become a pharmacist instead of registered dietitian‚Äù So I attended Bobcat Day and explored UC Merced. Although the campus is nice, it was in the middle of no where and js not rlly catching my eye. But I still forced myself to like it because my sister arranged this JUST for me and spent a good amount of money along with my dad. After some heavy consideration, I didn‚Äôt want to be away from my mom. I know it‚Äôs nice to give yourself some experience away from home but I realized I am too young/I have no experience. And my mom is moving to houston at the end of the year so I was like ‚ÄúI rlly hate UC Merced, I‚Äôll just go to community college js so I would be close to home, save money and get into a school I actually want to go to.‚Äù Altho many people dunk on CC, I think it‚Äôs a great pathway for those unsure of what they want to do with their lives. I would rather go to a CC and not know what I want than go to a university and force myself to do a major that isn‚Äôt what I want. However I have yet to tell my sister. She helped me get house (for free) and helped me through all the admissions. I just know she is going to be pissed off once she learns that I don‚Äôt wanna go to university for the full 4 years. And I want to go to CC. She looks heavily down on CC (even tho she went to one and transfered to UCSB) and told me to at least go to UC Merced for one year even though I told her that is not what I want. I feel extremely controlled by my sister and it‚Äôs giving me stress thinking about how angry she will learn that I want to be near my mom. I shouldve js picked a community college from the beginning instead of a university i dont even like.
And even though financial aid covered for a lot of my stuff, I still have no interest in UC Merced. 
I rlly wanna go to Purdue, UCSB, University of Maryland, GWU, UCSD, Texas A&M or even UCLA if the chance comes around!

(Im sorry if this is missing details or more context is needed, I can give more in the comments)

What I am asking is how should I approach her about it and what if she tries to convince me to go to a University I didn‚Äôt like just because she never was able to do the full 4 years?

"If I medically withdrew from college, how likely am I to be accepted at a new one?","
Hello everyone,

I graduated high school in 2017. My parents told me at the time that they would help pay for college *if* I chose a Christian college. I ended up choosing Colorado Christian University and was accepted. I started in their 2017 fall semester. 

For reasons that would take far too much time to explain (suppressed queer identity, *nasty* break-up, etc), I ended up *severely* depressed during just that first semester. So much so that I was skipping classes and even skipping *midterms.* Obviously, my GPA tanked. Professors and advisors reached out to try and help, and I blew them all off with excuses about 'family emergencies, work, blah blah' whatever bullshit excuse I could think of, anything but admit that I was incredibly suicidal. 

A short time later, I was put on Financial Aid Hold, which is was alerted my parents to the situation. I finally told the professors and advisors the truth about my situation, and they pretty unanimously suggested I Medically Withdraw from school. After a few counselling sessions, that is what I did. 

  
Now, here I am, years later, with no degree and wanting to go back to school. I'm worried, however, about my chances of being accepted to a new school with my record. Do any of the aforementioned things impact my likelihood of being accepted, or impact my likelihood of receiving financial aid? If so, is there anything I can do to.... 'fix' it? What are my options?

___


Edit: (unnecessary little vent, entirely irrelevant to the main point of my post ‚Äî just reflecting back):


It‚Äôs really daunting and frustrating to be 26, and finally begin to realize just how much my choices as an 18 year old are still messing with my future today. I have grace and kindness for that 18 year old ‚Äî they were an absolute wreck, confused, lonely, angry, careless. But that 18 year old also pretty royally messed up their own future. I wish I had taken a gap year rather than jump right into college at 18 when I wasn‚Äôt even sure I *wanted* to go to college; I wish I‚Äôd been honest with my professors right when the trouble started, because maybe then there would have been the chance to save my grades. Frankly, I wish I‚Äôd never chosen CCU lol, for a lot of other reasons. 

Because now, it feels as though that angry and sad little teen burned all my bridges. And in this economy, even people *with* degrees are struggling to find work ‚Äî so it probably comes as no surprise that I‚Äôve been out of work for a year now, despite endless applications and attempts at finding *anything.* 

It‚Äôs strange, because 18 year old me definitely didn‚Äôt expect there would ever *be* a 26 year old me. I wasn‚Äôt concerned for my future, because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have one. Now, im in that kid‚Äôs future, wishing I‚Äôd done so many things differently.

"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here.

"Update to Metadata Saga>","Just wanted to share a quick and honestly kind of hilarious update to my previous rant about my school accusing students of academic dishonesty based on document metadata, shared templates, and even bold text. The most ironic part is that all of this happened in a Social and Legal Relationships in Forensic Science class. A class literally about how evidence and legal systems work was punishing students for things like metadata they didn‚Äôt understand, formatting choices, and templates given by the instructor. They were teaching us about due process, burden of proof, chain of custody, and fairness in criminal investigations while simultaneously saying that having two authors listed in a Word document was probably cheating. The standard of evidence they used was ridiculously low basically if something ‚Äúlooked suspicious,‚Äù that was enough to accuse students, and the burden was on the students to prove their innocence. If it wasn‚Äôt so damaging to students, it would be comedy. They kept insisting the process was educational and not punitive, yet students were flagged, questioned, stressed out, and sometimes penalized for normal things like bolding subheadings or using the provided file. The hypocrisy was wild.  It was lower then even a civil court case. Now that I‚Äôm officially an alum, I can fully say I survived the academic integrity circus and the irony that came with it. Thanks for all the support and validation on the last post .You all made me feel way less crazy.

 **TL;DR** The cheating accusations over metadata, templates, and formatting all came from a forensic science class about law and evidence. They used a ridiculously low standard of proof basically just ‚Äúlooks suspicious‚Äù was enough to accuse students, and it was up to the students to prove they didn‚Äôt cheat.

I am 19 and live in Washington state..I've been going to a local community college and I keep failing classes even though I do well on the quizzes and tests+ regular assignments, normally 80% or higher, I've gone for 2 quarters and failed every single class because of some technicality or cause of my disability keeping me from doing work for a couple days (I have a congenital heart condition) I have had a professor tell me to drop her class when I told her I couldn't do work a certain day because of my health issues, I understand that college is different than highschool, but I went to a different college on the opposite side of the state right after graduating HS and they were great, I loved the campus and the professors were understanding and very kind...I could not continue attending due to my health declining due to lack of medical services in the area..
My current college I attend is so difficult for online students, which f ING sucks, my auntie just graduated with her 3rd degree from there and she did not have this hard of a time at all! 

I was trying to look into online universities, the main 2 that come up are FullSail and SNHU which are both way too expensive...are there any good online school options? Due to my disability I have to stay close to my home city...there seem to be no legitimate places for online education, I just don't know what to do...if anyone has suggestions at all that'd be appreciated, I apologise for the long rant..

"Help ‚Äî Any vets save their GI Bill for grad school? How did you fund undergrad courses or a second degree without it?","TL;DR / BLUF:
Separated veteran with an online bachelor‚Äôs (Environmental Science) wants to pursue a PhD in Oceanography, but lacks hands-on experience and foundational skills. I‚Äôm trying to save my GI Bill for grad school, so I‚Äôm looking for advice on how others funded additional undergrad coursework or a second degree without using GI Bill benefits. Any tips or experiences appreciated. 

Hey everyone,
I recently separated from the military and I‚Äôm trying to make a big shift, but I‚Äôm running into some roadblocks and could really use advice from anyone who‚Äôs been here.

I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Environmental Science: Fish & Wildlife Management, earned online while I was still in. I want to pursue a PhD in Oceanography at ODU, but I‚Äôm realizing I may not be ready for grad school yet.

I don‚Äôt have any real-world experience in the field ‚Äî no GIS, no water sampling, no lab work. The structure of my undergrad (8-week online courses, finished quickly thanks to transfer credits) didn‚Äôt give me a solid foundation. I essentially started as a second-semester junior and flew through it. Now that I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm feeling the gap.

I want to save my GI Bill for graduate school, but I‚Äôm strongly considering taking additional undergrad courses ‚Äî or even starting a second degree ‚Äî just to get the background I need. The problem is, I don‚Äôt know how to fund that schooling without touching my GI Bill.

‚∏ª

Has anyone here:
	‚Ä¢	Chosen to hold off on using the GI Bill until grad school?
	‚Ä¢	Found a way to fund additional undergrad courses or a second bachelor‚Äôs (grants, FAFSA, state aid, anything)?
	‚Ä¢	Navigated something similar after separating ‚Äî where your degree existed on paper, but didn‚Äôt prepare you for real opportunities?

‚∏ª

I‚Äôm 30 now, and while I know that‚Äôs not ‚Äúold,‚Äù it does make me more conscious of time and debt. I don‚Äôt want to spend years spinning my wheels or use my GI Bill on a degree that won‚Äôt directly move me toward my career in marine/ocean sciences.

Any insight, funding tips, or just experiences from others who‚Äôve taken this kind of path would mean a lot. I just want to build a life outside of the military that feels like it‚Äôs going somewhere solid.

Thanks in advance.

"Retaking a class I got a B in","I retook a Calculus AB class I took last year. I had a B+ first semester, and a B second semester. I initially had an A, but my math teacher intentionally lowered my grade after the finals were all complete without any explanation. (Specifically my grade) When I questioned him about it, he gave BS answers like ""This is a hard class, there's no reason for you to get an A"". I was really upset, because there was no reason for him to do that. I also don't know why he would have the time to change an individual student's grade. It was well above an A, and no other assignment would have changed it. 

I retook the class recently with a different teacher and got an A just fine both semesters. 

Now I'm concerened what story this will tell to the Ivies and the T20 schools. Will this decrease my chances and make it seem like I'm obsessed with my grades? Is there a note I can add to let them know about this situation? Both grades will show up on the transcript.

"Financial Aid advice for a disabled student with parents who both work.","I‚Äôm a 21 year old university student in my third-ish year of undergrad going to Canada as an international student. My country of origin is the United States and I live incredibly close to the border. All the schools that accepted me in the US, yes even public schools (my state is generally more expensive overall), were more expensive than going to school in Canada. Tuition alone at a state school here is equivalent to both tuition and room and board at my current institution.

Even though I am so close to finishing up my degree, I may have to drop out due to lack of financial aid.

Let‚Äôs just say my family is not quite the genetically blessed bunch; both of my parents, my sister, as well as myself all have medical issues that require we go to multiple specialists. My father has had to get multiple surgeries done in the past five years. For a decent amount of time, I was on disability medicaid through our state‚Äôs program, but it has long since expired and has been a pain to reinstate due to the fact that I needed a part time job to help my family pay off our regular expenses and also just because of how convoluted every governmentally run program is to apply for.

My situation now: I am in need of about $25,000 USD for school this upcoming year. I was able to receive a small amount of an unsubsidized loan already from FAFSA, but they aren‚Äôt offering me more and determine my SAI to be high due to the fact that within the past few (less than 5) years my parents have gotten better paying jobs. It feels so unfair that they only judge your need based on income and not income-to-debt, or recognize that ALMOST ALL OF OUR MONEY IS GOING TO PAY OFF OLD MEDICAL BILLS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CHARGES $75 FOR A BAND-AID!!! There is no additional student aid program for disabled students!

Our credit scores are all terrible because of how many times we‚Äôve had to take out loans and put medical bills on credit cards after my dad‚Äôs major procedures and even our regular copays and medication costs. I‚Äôve been approved for a Sallie Mae loan last year, but now I am not getting approved for one this year. My school doesn‚Äôt accept many other types of student/education specific program funding directly (due to the international aspect?), and at this point I don‚Äôt care if I need to take out a personal loan with a terrible interest rate and transfer that money to my student account- I just need to finish my program.

So basically, I am in desperate need of advice and recommendations of where else to go for getting loans or if anybody knows of any scholarship opportunities for disabled students, or hell even if there‚Äôs a way to eliminate our medical debt through some forgiveness program as that would get rid of my family‚Äôs main issue entirely. We are just completely stuck and I really don‚Äôt want to quit on my education especially when I‚Äôve gotten this far and already accrued education debt from what I‚Äôve already started.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lvnf15/financial_aid_advice_for_a_disabled_student_with/","1752078923.0","college","OkRecover5897"

I‚Äôll be heading off to college soon, and unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have thousands of dollars just sitting around to cover tuition‚ÄîI'm guessing that‚Äôs the case for most students! I‚Äôm planning on taking out a loan, but here‚Äôs where my anxiety kicks in.

"Thinking of going back to school!","I‚Äôve been in and out of school for a few years now. My freshman year officially started in 2016 where I did two and half years of community college before transferring to university. I majored in English: Creative Writing with a minor in communications, originally hoping to land a job in the publishing world.

"How badly hurt will I be by Trump‚Äôs Big ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù Bill?","Title. I (22M) am a student who is going to my local state university full time & who works part time in retail to help pay for expenses. I come from a relatively poor background & live with my parents. I get the full pell grant.

I am worried about this big bill that just became law. Supposedly, its affects on student aid will begin after July 1st, 2026. I would be going into my senior year at that time. 

From what I read in the bill, I will need to be in 15 credits instead of 12 to be considered a full time student. The pell grant is being reduced & subsidized loan options are being eliminated. That leaves me in a tight spot since that aid is what makes it possible for me to attend college. I will probably need to see if I can qualify for some extra need-based aid from my uni & I will need to save up starting now.


Please tell me if I am panicking & overreacting? Can you please give me any other advice, if possible? Thank you for reading my post.

"I'm losing hope because of Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill""","I just turned 20 in may. The same month I moved to Texas from Alabama because I was kicked out and living in my car. I came here to Texas to live with my ex-stepfather but it will not work long term whatsoever. I haven't gotten a job yet, I'm constantly rejected from the most menial of positions.

I'm still constantly applying, and if it comes to it I'll just work for the minimum wage, but here is my issue.

My reason for coming here at all was to try and get into a University here and either enter a study abroad program, or outright attend a foreign university.

I got myself into a community college, and my gpa is a 3.6 so far after two semesters.

But now, with Trump's Bill, I do not think I can afford any University here in Texas. I rely on snap benefits, and I'm facing homelessness. My dream of going overseas is becoming less of a dream and more of a desperate escape plan. But the goal was always to use my community college gpa to get into a University here, and then use my gpa there to get into a University overseas.

I have no set choice, I've been casually researching Germany only because I am most familiar with it.

But Germany doesn't acknowledge community college credits(I don't know if they'd care about my gpa either) and I doubt many other countries do.

My high school gpa is a 2.1 because my mother forced me out of school constantly because of her own beliefs and so I barely graduated. I thought I'd finally gotten past this, I knew it wouldn't be easy, but now it seems impossible.

If I can't afford university here, or snap is taken away, or I'm homeless again and the shelters lose funding. All I can think of is to drop out of community college and go to trade school.

But I don't want to live like this, I was kicked out because I want to pursue forensic science, and I stood my ground to achieve this. It feels like everything is working against me.

I am genuinely so lost. I'm trying to have a better future for my sister, to pave the way so she has a easy road to follow. But i'm caught in thorns and I feel like all she'll find is my corpse. How is she going to succeed if I can't?

I started learning German because its the least I can do, but I'll make it clear I am not set on Germany. The UK, Netherlands, etc seem fine to me. I'm sure the international aspects are better for other subs but I'm asking what am I meant to do now?

Is community college worth it anymore? Should I even try to go to a university here or should I take off for another country and then work my way up to an education there?

I feel like I'm running out of time, that if I don't do something I'm going to be poor and miserable just like everyone else in my family.

Originally I was going to have a 3 month stay in different European countries next year as soon as my passport is prepared, to see if I even like that environment/the culture, but now I don't know if I can even afford that or if I should just be jumping head first.

I feel like I've been born too late, I didn't have enough time to prove myself valuable with school so no country would see me as a priority. I know I am far from the only one attempting to leave the US. I hoped I could attend a school here long enough to make myself just valuable enough, but now I just don't think its possible when I only have so much in savings.

If I could get organized enough to figure out what I'm meant to be doing then I can do more research on my own, but now I'm overwhelmed and lost.

  
Edit: I am not expecting miracles! I will work as hard as I have to, and I know that Europe isn't a magical land of success. I want to get out of poverty no matter where I am, and now it seems that an education here won't do it unless I follow the same path my father and his father did, which didn't work.

Please give me the benefit of the doubt. I am young and na√Øve about a lot of things, but I know running to another country won't magically fix all my problems at the very least. I just want to understand the correct and most logical steps to take while working for this.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lrqif4/im_losing_hope_because_of_trumps_big_beautiful/","1751655407.0","college","vomitonvelvet"

"Appealing - school denied my final semester","Hi everyone  
  
I‚Äôm writing this post because I recently received news that my school won‚Äôt let me proceed to my final semester, and I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm appealing the decision but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll work, and I‚Äôd really appreciate advice or support.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I had to undergo two major surgeries for medical reasons at the start of my 6th semester (7 semesters in total).
* I‚Äôve been living alone since both of my parents passed away in 2023. When I began school in 2022, they were alive and I lived with them, so I had financial stability (I was 24 at the time).
* After their death, I‚Äôve been managing everything alone: paying rent, working 80% (4 days/week) just to survive while doing 2.5 days of school and studying weekends for almost weekly exams, doing my assignments etc.
* I‚Äôm also undergoing HRT since 2022, which has been medically necessary for me.
* Despite being under extreme stress and depression, I still passed most subjects. I was only half a grade (!!!) short of making it through.
* I had repeated a year before due to the emotional toll (HRT and parents), but I bounced back.
* The school was cold and inflexible about my situation, even when my surgeon had to step in to confirm the surgeries‚Äô importance. They didn't want to let me get my surgeries basically and I had to fight for it.
* I feel this is deeply unfair since I‚Äôm six months away from graduating and I‚Äôve fought through things most people thankfully never have to.

I‚Äôm appealing the decision, attaching documentation like the surgery confirmation, death certificates (perhaps optional since they're confidential to me), employment records, mail exchanges with my doctors, and more.

Any advice on how to word this better, or similar experiences? Do you think I can receive empathy to my situation?

I took a year off after a rough period‚Äîmy mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.

For context, i‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I‚Äôve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.

Since January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven‚Äôt been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîmeds, structured routines, new environments‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt focus or motivate myself. It‚Äôs like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.

Now I‚Äôm questioning everything. I don‚Äôt enjoy my course and can‚Äôt picture myself in a 9‚Äì5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing‚Äîespecially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I‚Äôm terrified this would confirm it.

I want to get better, but I don‚Äôt know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.

Any advice or support would mean a lot. Thanks üòä","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lp987x/should_i_drop_out_of_university_because_of_mental/","1751394119.0","college","Better_Sprinkles_286"

"I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind this upcoming semester","I (F21) just attended orientation for my university. I'm moving hours away from home to a city I‚Äôve visited a grand total of one time.

I'm a psych major who wants to go to grad school. I'm also the obnoxious student who's in 10 different clubs. Last year, while I was still in community college, I balanced Student Media, occasional student government meetings, PTK, helping to organize campus events, and SkillsUSA‚Äîall while taking classes, applying to multiple universities for transfer, and working on campus, sometimes up to 20 hours per week.

I blame this on my ADHD, really, because my brain goes, ""HEY, I WANNA DO THAT THING!

So I do the thing... kinda, sorta. I usually procrastinate, barely hold everything together, and break down every so often. But I do get it done, so yay?

So, as I'm leaving for university, I'm unfortunately taking my neuroticism with me. But I'm also severely burnt out. I have been for a while, really.

And yet, I‚Äôm actually really excited for school‚Äîmeeting new people, learning new things, research, all that fun stuff. I have a really weird love-hate relationship with academia.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôve already started stressing out, as orientation has been a huge information overload. Do I apply for internships right now? A job? Volunteer work? Organizations? What‚Äôs the appropriate level of proactiveness? Why am I the only loser attending any of the optional sessions?

Anyway, I'm seeing a therapist on Wednesday, but I‚Äôd love to hear any advice from people who‚Äôve been in university longer‚Äîpreferably if you‚Äôre anything like me (I‚Äôll pray for you)‚Äîon how you manage your schedule between class and extracurricular activities.

Or is any of this stuff even worth it in the long run?","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1loicnl/im_afraid_im_going_to_lose_my_mind_this_upcoming/","1751315405.0","college","moonchildvii"
"I can't focus on anything, and it's killing me slowly.","I swear, I've tried everything to make myself work on my english assignments. Attempting to schedule my day, isolating myself from any distractions, trying to meditate and refocus myself between studying and working, but every time I just feel more tired and unmotivated to work on anything, even personal hobbies I keep telling myself I want to do. Instead, I just fall back to watching some stupid video or playing some game I'm never good at, and every time, I scream at myself for being such a failure. Every time I try to open my overdue essay, I can't help but feel a awful wave of nauseating regret for what I've done to myself, and even still I cannot seem to focus and work on it.
The few folks I know are much too busy with their schedule to help, and even then, all I get is ""just do it"" or ""use A.I"" (my professors explicitly use a.i detectors).
If things don't go well, then this will be the third college-level english class I've failed, so can someone please give advice on how to get out of this rut I've found myself in.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lohkhx/i_cant_focus_on_anything_and_its_killing_me_slowly/","1751313591.0","college","VNNNNVN"
"I‚Äôm switching paths‚Äîneed help choosing a major.","Hi all, I‚Äôm currently studying in Italy in a bachelor‚Äôs program called *‚ÄúSocial Innovation, Communication, and New Technologies‚Äù*. It‚Äôs an interdisciplinary degree mixing computer science, design, and social sciences. I originally picked it with the goal of becoming a UX designer or digital marketer‚Äîsomething job-ready and practical.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve realised I don‚Äôt want to work in tech or design anymore. What I really care about is **academia**, **research**, and working in institutions like the **EU**, **UN**, **NGOs**, or **think tanks**. I want to do a **master‚Äôs (probably abroad)**, then hopefully a **PhD**. Ideally I‚Äôd like to end up in Belgium, the Netherlands, or maybe stay in Italy.

Right now, I‚Äôm torn about what to do. My current degree feels too applied, and I‚Äôm seriously considering switching to something like:

* **Political Science**
* **Sociology**
* **Economics**
* or even **History** (though it feels a bit abstract and less ‚Äúmarketable‚Äù)

The upside is that I‚Äôm not taking on any debt (I get a stipend) and both my BA and MA would be **fully funded in Italy**, so I have flexibility. I just don‚Äôt want to waste time in a degree that won‚Äôt get me where I want to be.

So‚Ä¶ what major is best for my goals? How do I know what‚Äôs truly right for me?

Would love to hear from anyone in similar fields or paths.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lnw8nc/im_switching_pathsneed_help_choosing_a_major/","1751250176.0","college","Thecrazypacifist"

"How I finally fixed my broken communication skills (with 5 books that saved me)","I used to feel like I completely lacked communication skills. Even a ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day‚Äù could shut down my brain. After getting laid off, I spiraled. Every interaction felt like a test I couldn‚Äôt pass. I‚Äôd nod and smile while silently screaming at myself to say something. At night, I replayed every awkward moment like a horror movie. I felt broken. So I got help. I worked with a social coach for a full year and what I learned changed everything. If you‚Äôve ever felt like your mind just blanks, this post is for you.

The biggest thing my coach said was this: you‚Äôre not boring, you‚Äôre buffering. The thoughts are there. Anxiety just blocks them from surfacing. Once I stopped trying to be interesting and started learning how to organize my thoughts, everything shifted.

Here‚Äôs what actually helped:

‚Ä¢ Anxiety steals your working memory which makes retrieval hard in real time

‚Ä¢ Good conversation is about recognizing patterns not inventing new thoughts

‚Ä¢ The more present you are the more your energy leads the flow

These 5 books helped me rebuild my social confidence from scratch

[Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king) by Patrick King: Patrick breaks down conversations into simple and repeatable stages. This book helped me stop overthinking and start flowing. After reading it I stopped panicking about what to say next and focused more on just being there.

[Smart Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/smart-talk-by-lisa-b-marshall) by Lisa B Marshall: This book gave me the actual phrasing structures to sound smoother without memorizing scripts. Reading it on BeFreed made it even easier to digest and apply. I finally felt like I had a roadmap in my head instead of noise.

[Just Listen](https://www.befreed.ai/book/just-listen-by-mark-goulston) by Mark Goulston: Mark is a renowned psychiatrist and coach featured in Forbes. This book taught me how to diffuse defensiveness and make people feel truly heard. The Persuasion Cycle section alone shifted my conversations from awkward to connected. First convo I applied it to? Game changer.¬†

[How to Talk to Anyone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35210.How_to_Talk_to_Anyone) by Leil Lowndes: This is a classic for a reason. It‚Äôs packed with 92 small but powerful tools that actually work in real conversations. It gave me go-to ways to start, maintain, and deepen connections. After reading it, small talk started to feel a lot more genuine and less forced.¬†

[Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22836493-influence) by Robert Cialdini: One of the most famous psychology books ever written. It changed how I think about connection and persuasion. Helped me build rapport and read social cues without second guessing myself all the time.¬†

If your brain ever goes blank mid conversation you‚Äôre not alone and you‚Äôre not broken. Read ten minutes a day. Practice just one tool at a time. The more you show up the easier it gets. Real confidence is built through small wins and it‚Äôs always learnable.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1lusg7v/how_i_finally_fixed_my_broken_communication/","1751990541.0","highschool","karma_1264"

"I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life and feel like a failure.","Hey there. I'm F(23) currently attending university. This is my second attempt. I dropped out my first major after 3 semesters, then worked several jobs over the course of a year and earned some money. I moved places. I'm now attending university again, but a different major. It feels pointless. 

Today I was supposed to take an exam. I don't know what exactly happened but I stayed home because I felt like there was no way i'm passing this one anyway. I did study, but I simply have 0 motivation or trust to actually complete it. I don't know if I'll be able to retake it. My family and friends are so supportive and I could never tell them that it's going wrong again. 

I work in a small private owned bookshop which is nice I guess, but this is no help for my future. I like writing poems and wrote a novel since I dreamt about becoming an author when I was younger but I just don't see a point anymore, it's not even good. 

I don't know what to do with my failed life. I can't possibly drop out of university again but i dont think I can force myself to finish either, I have zero qualifications on paper besides regular school and have no clue which direction to go in my career. I work out a lot but I can't turn my hobbies into a job and even though I have a lot of people in my life I feel super lonely and disconnected from all of them. My dating life is non existent not by lack of choices but I just can't be in a healthy relationship right now because I'm a mess.

"Baby daddy trouble","This is gonna be a long one so apologies in advance. I have only used Reddit a couple of times so I‚Äôm still not 100% if I‚Äôm doing it right.

For context- I am F20 and my ex/baby daddy is M21. We were together for 2years. When we first got together we took a lot of drugs, all the time. We would drink and sniff nearly every day. I won‚Äôt get into that too much because I was in a really dark place and don‚Äôt like to think about it. I found out I was pregnant and immediately stopped drinking/ taking stuff. We had a huge conversation about if we wanted to keep the baby and if we did- what that would mean for our lifestyles. I obviously said ‚Äúthe drugs need to stop‚Äù he agreed. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to end up being the kind of dad his dad was for him. I thought we were on the same page. Fast forward to 7 days before my due date. He took drugs then admitted he had been doing so throughout my pregnancy. I was obviously heartbroken so I moved out of his and his dads flat and moved into my unfurnished flat and had my mum and friends come over to help me build furniture etc. I was really angry and felt totally betrayed but again he played the victim and made me feel like I was the one who was horrible for moving out and needing space. I eventually caved and let him move in. Fast forward, my sweet baby boy is born. Next thing, he‚Äôs taking drugs again and thought he could just walk into MY house and be around our baby. Absolutely not. I threw him out, broke up with him and told him to collect his things the next day. Again, absolutely heartbroken. A little bit more info, this man would get drunk/high/both, come home and start arguments over nothing. Either that or he would shout at me (making no sense, I can‚Äôt understand him) spitting on me, calling me all the horrible names under the sun. Trust me, I know he‚Äôs awful. So then moving onto now. We had a conversation on Friday, which I thought went really good. I miss him so much and I have so much love for him, he is definitely my first love and the father to my baby. He told me he still loves me, he only sees himself with me, he‚Äôs going to make and effort‚Ä¶ most importantly ‚Äúyou were never really my ex‚Äù We ended the conversation on the note that he was gonna put in an effort and we could get back together and work things out. Keep this in mind and also the fact I have been totally loyal to him throughout our relationship and even after I threw him out, I would lay my life on the line for him. Another bit of context, I thought maybe if I threw him out maybe he‚Äôd come to his senses and realise ‚Äúdamn she really does care about me and she only wants what‚Äôs best for me and our baby. She‚Äôs encouraging me to be a better dad‚Äù Our baby is 6months old btw. Now on Saturday, so literally the day after we had this talk about getting back together and how I was never really his ex.. we happened to be at the same event. After the event me and my friend were waiting to be picked up (I haven‚Äôt seen him all night at this point) when he walks straight past me with some other girl. I run to him and ask him what the hell he‚Äôs doing and if last night meant nothing to him. He says he‚Äôs kissed her and he‚Äôs going home with her. My heart has absolutely shattered once again. Flash to now, it‚Äôs only a couple days since it happened so I know it‚Äôs normal to hurt. I guess the advice I‚Äôm asking for is how do I get over this as quickly as possible. I can‚Äôt stop crying and blaming myself and feeling angry and since I am the primary carer of my son (he lives with me, his dad has him usually two days per week) my sadness is rubbing off on him. He‚Äôs such a happy little boy but everytime I start to cry so does he. I don‚Äôt want him to feel how I feel. I don‚Äôt want to be incapable of making my baby happy because I‚Äôm too wrapped up in my own sadness. I know at least someone will have went through something like this in their life so please please give me advice on how to just wipe my tears and move on. I know baby daddy is horrible, I was the one that had to live with him. I was the one who got loved bombed, gaslighted, the whole works. He was absolutely useless after I gave birth. I was stitched and in agony, could barely shift position without crying in pain and yet he wouldn‚Äôt even pick up the housework for me. I was made out to be a burden and annoying if I asked him to hang clean washing on the clothes horse because I was physically incapable of doing it. So I know he‚Äôs useless and I know I‚Äôm better than that, I just want to know how to stop feeling like this. I‚Äôm on sertraline because I‚Äôm already depressed lol so please don‚Äôt suggest meds. I need some genuine supportive advice and tips. How do I get over such a heartbreak?

"Getting my life together. 32F","Hi all! 

New to this subreddit but just wanted to share some victories I've had recently. I'm very proud of myself and don't have a lot of close people to share things with, so here I am. I didn't have the most stable upbringing and unfortunately picked up some unhealthy and avoidant coping skills along the way, which has caused a plethora of physical and mental health issues over the last 15 or so years. But I'm working so hard to get better and I think I'm actually doing it. 

It started with a video I saw, some crappy tubi movie short or something, where a woman visits another woman's home for an appointment and the homeowner tries to cancel when she gets there because she's totally overwhelmed. She's got a toddler running around screaming, a baby in a highchair screaming, and the house is trashed. 

The woman visiting goes ""Listen, I had to walk two blocks here from the bus stop in dress shoes. I'm coming in."" She goes inside and sees the absolute chaos in the house and after multiple disruptions from the kids she springs into action. Picks up the baby from the highchair and soothes it, gives the toddler a toy to play with and tells him sternly to sit down and be quiet and he does. The house is suddenly calm. Mom starts crying and asks ""How do you do it? I don't think I can do this."" and the woman responds, ""You just do it. What you're doing right now is thinking about doing it. Don't do that. Just do it."" I don't know man. It just struck me and it struck me hard as cheesy as ""Just do it."" is (queue Shia LaBeouf). 

That day I sat down and scheduled a dentist appointment and actually went. Got a deep teeth cleaning (you know, where they numb you and dig deep in your gums) and the smell was terrible. I promised the hygienest and myself I was going to do better. And you know what? I have. I've been flossing, brushing, and cleaning my tongue and mouth every night for two months. When I went back for another exam and to build a treatment plan they were shocked at the difference in the health of my gums. No inflammation, zero bleeding, and no food or tarter came out during the regular cleaning. Next week I get my cavities filled and my ugly front tooth that is chipped and falling apart repaired. After that I can smile again! 

With the little confidence I gained at that appointment I scheduled an appointment with a primary care provider. I've been scared for a long time because I knew the blood tests would be bad. I've been overweight most of my life and have been shamed by doctors a ton so I stopped going. But recently I've started having symptoms of pre diabetes and I want a family while I still have time so I stopped thinking about doing it and I did it. 

The results were bad. Cholesterol bad. Insulin bad. Liver enzymes worse. I've got another blood test coming up for the liver after fasting from alcohol so I'll know more about that soon. But I promised my doctor and myself I was going to do better and I have. I eat a salad every day for lunch now and track my calories and macros. I started playing Pok√©mon go and walk 3-5 times a week for an hour. 2-3 times a week I've been doing some strength training with kettlebells at home. It sucks. My feet, legs, and back hurt and it's embarrassing to be fat in public. But I'm doing it anyways. 

I've also been avoiding issues with my car because I work from home and don't really need it often. If I need to go somewhere I use my roommates car, but I worried what would happen if something happens to me or my pets while he's gone and I need to get somewhere quick fast and in a hurry. We tried jumping it to get it to the shop but the battery was so depleted it wouldn't even stay on. 

The registration also expired in 2022 so the thought of driving it really freaked me out. So I decided to just get it towed. And of course when I got to the shop they didn't even have the type of battery my crappy 2013 Chryster 200 takes. I rode with the tow so the only thing I could do was walk over to the closest auto zone in light rain on a hope and a prayer. They had 1 left in stock and it was expensive. But I payed the price of my neglect, picked that bad boy up in my arms like a baby, covered it with my jacket, and slowly walked back to the shop. Car batteries are heavy okay? I was covered in sweat and raindrops when I got there. But I got there and drove home in my running car that same day (without getting a ticket). 

Admittedly, I did procrastinate the registration for a few weeks after getting the car running again. I live in an area that requires emissions testing and knew I was due but had no idea where to start. Our DMVs are appointment only and the people are super mean so I was also scared to call and ask. But today I stopped thinking about doing it and just drove over to the testing place. Immediately the guy goes nope, can't test you, go to the office. 

They had to put me back in their system because it had been so long. Then I drove back over and passed the emissions! Went back to the office and they said nope, can't renew you here. Go to the dmv. So I sulked home to look for appointments and the closest openings were like 2 hours away. I said screw it and went to my closest one anyways. Turns out you don't need an appointments for plates. Was in and out in 30 minutes. Just put on my new plates. I have a functioning and street legal car after 3 years of procrastination and avoidance. 

This month I'll do my liver blood tests, get my teeth fixed, and see my new OBGYN. I'll keep eating healthy and walking and taking care of my teeth.

Sorry for the long post, I'm just feeling lighter than usual and like life is looking up. And even if it starts looking down at some point again, which unavoidably it will, I feel confident I can take that on and stabilize. Thanks for reading my little and big victories, and for those who didn't... 

Tldr;
Fixed my oral hygiene. Getting teeth fixed soon.
Scheduled OBGYN appointment and saw a PCP for blood tests. 
Blood tests came back bad. Started eating healthier, walking, and weight training.
Got my car running and new license plates today. 
Stopped dreading it, started doing it. 

I guess it sounds easy when I put it like that.

"How do I cope with the emotion of leaving my mom for Hostel?","I have just started out college in a far and  different city, away from my mom. For college, I have been allotted to a hostel room. 

For a misanthrope and withdrawn person like me, it's difficult to be present in class without feeling lonely. 

I've shifted to a city where people don't even talk my language. So, there's a language barrier. I feel like an outsider in my college. Moreover, I've never slept a night without my Mom by my side. 

Right now, 2:18 a.m in the night and I am unable to fall asleep. I miss my mom alot. I've been crying for 2-3 hours straight. I don't know when I'll ever see my mom again. She is unwell and I'm scared for not being there for her when she'll need someone.

"i feel like a failure and don‚Äôt deserve the program i‚Äôm in","Just a rant because I feel lost and overwhelmed. Yesterday I enrolled to one of the best universities in my country as a freshman and got the first day because I was one of the top scorers. I was a STEM student who applied to an english language studies program because I‚Äôve always loved writing. There were so many people vying for slots that I ended up waiting for four hours just to finally go and sit where I‚Äôll be interviewed. 

The dean of the program interviewed me and I just completely sucked. I‚Äôve always had trouble communicating and bad anxiety problems but I didn‚Äôt think it would come biting me back at such a crucial time. I completely blanked out and couldn‚Äôt answer a basic question, something related to the eight parts of a speech and I couldn‚Äôt answer at all, only half. Which I remembered right after the interview. It was so bad I forgot about what even happened. Although I still got accepted in the program somehow, I still can‚Äôt forget how the dean told me how she could even accept me in when I couldn‚Äôt answer such a basic question. 

Her assistant (the one who actually was assigned to do the interviews) took over, and he spoke to me about how impressive and high my grades were but how he valued performance over numbers. And that since I was the first applicant he wanted to accept me despite my situation and that because there were many programs but I still chose them, he was willing to give me a slot but that he would remember me. I can‚Äôt help but feel I barely got in and ONLY got in because I was pitied. That I truly don‚Äôt deserve a place there. I feel humiliated by how I let my anxiety get the best of me at such an important moment and embarrassed that it was the first impression of me that the most important people of my program got. I don‚Äôt know if I actually deserve to go here and feel like I‚Äôll never catch up with my future classmates. I don‚Äôt know how to cope with my self doubts anymore because of how anxious I am all the time.

"Feeling frustrated with my experience so far","I've been taking classes entirely online at a community college because I don't have a way to get to class and I can't afford university right now... It's been pretty bad to say the least. I'm taking summer classes right now, and this is my first year. I haven't been on campus at all. I haven't made any friends or had any kind of fun experience because I just can't afford it. It's really disheartening seeing my friends post about their experiences at university and I'm still at home. All I do is do my assignments and then go to work. 

Moreover, some of this classes are just? Terrible? I've been taking classes nonstop, no breaks, and I am kind of reaching the end of my rope. Especially when I keep getting classes where the teacher doesn't even interact with the class at all or provide any instruction. Out of all the classes I've taken so far, I've had ONE teacher do recorded lectures. (And they don't even help. She posts several of them on Monday, all for one unit, then has an assignment due on Tuesday that tanks my overall grade at least 5 points if I score anything below an 80.)

I'm just tired. I'm tired of missing out. I'm tired of doing schoolwork. Tired of teaching myself everything. I wanted to get my associates and transfer to a university to save money but at this rate I don't even think I'll make it there. It doesn't feel like there's even a point to any of it at all. I didn't even want to go to college but it feels like if I ever want to make any kind of money that I have to. I used to be an incredible student in highschool but I just hate college. If I drop out now I'll never hear the end of it from my family... I don't think I will drop out but I can't get over the fact that the second I stop having assignments, my mental health immediately improves. I just had a week long break (for some reason my college gave us one but I'm not complaining) and the moment it ended, my mental health tanked. Throughout my life my mental health has always been really bad, with a lot of suicidal ideation and even attempts. But the moment I get a break from school, it just seems to melt away. I never wanted to go back to school. I just wanted to stop feeling so bad but it seems I don't have a choice. Just this first year alone I've had a few close calls. It's terrible.

"I‚Äôm a huge college hater despite being a good student.","I go to a U.S. college in the Midwest.

Anytime I talk to people they tell me I should just ‚Äúdo what makes me happy‚Äù but I really just want to get my bachelor‚Äôs over with. 

I‚Äôm taking summer classes rn and going into my 3rd year. I‚Äôm so insanely burnt out and I just can‚Äôt seem to stay on top of all my classes and responsibilities consistently. 

My perspective on college is super negative, and I tried my best to be delusional and romanticize it as much as possible but I just can‚Äôt.

This is my experience:
- Balancing a social life is insanely difficult (there‚Äôs nothing fun to do in a Midwest town, my friends are working or at different colleges/we drifted apart, making new friends is pointless because we‚Äôre not gonna be taking the same classes to really invest time in connecting)
- My family is constantly downplaying how hard it is and telling me to eat a snack, take a nap, or just being loud when I‚Äôm trying to study (no one has a degree/people dropped out or never tried- I‚Äôm trying not to follow)
- Professors are just on constant power trips that you have to kiss up to them. The phrase ‚Äúteachers make or break your grade‚Äù has never hit harder. I feel even worse when I get actual good professors but I fall behind because I‚Äôm catching up in the courses of the bad ones.
- Getting a good or bad grade doesn‚Äôt even register to me anymore. Good grade? Gee, on to the next. Bad grade? Damn, doesn‚Äôt even matter. 
- The scholarships I got barely cover anything, and all the $ I get from doing part-time jobs go right back into school. Debt is accumulating.
- College is essentially spending money to teach yourself, maneuvering professors, class projects, time-wasting assignments, and spending time in lecture halls trying not to lose your mind. 
- The material that‚Äôs relatively easy just end up being time-consuming for no reason, and the material that‚Äôs hard just burns me out cause I know it‚Äôll either be something I never use again or something I‚Äôll ‚Äúbarely‚Äù apply in the future. 
- Your worth being summed up in percentages, point systems, papers, exams, participation- actually insane. How bout I jump out this mf window and touch some grass!
- Gen-Ed‚Äôs and electives have got to be the dumbest money scams disguised as being a ‚Äúwell-rounded education.‚Äù
- College being the time to explore can be a lie when they ruin your favorite subjects and/or add up time to graduate.
- Oh you took this difficult class cause it was required? Never mind, it‚Äôs actually not required anymore so you wasted your time and it just counts as random credit hours now!
- Oh you thought these were the classes you were supposed to take and you planned out your four years already? Oops, we added a few more required classes cause we wanted to ‚Äúimprove the the curriculum,‚Äù have fun adding those in.
- Staring at a laptop for hours on end every day whether I move locations or not never gets better.
- My will to live is gone, my social life is barely hanging on, and the burnout will only get worse from here.
- My hobbies aren‚Äôt even enjoyable anymore because I‚Äôm thinking about all the things I have to do.
- I‚Äôve pretty much calculated every possible route I could take for my future and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm a failure and college just isn‚Äôt meant for me. 
- Time, energy, money, all getting depleted simultaneously for a piece of paper that shows people ‚Äúhey look I can do this‚Äù
- College is truly the boss that ends all if you can‚Äôt stay disciplined or romanticize it.
- I honestly feel better when people collectively say, ‚Äúcollege sucks and the system sucks but we‚Äôre here‚Äù instead of ‚Äúeverything in life is hard, choose your hard‚Äù like oh lawd ik gimme a break

"To instructors: what to do about an indifferent professor?","This wasn't allowed to be posted on r/AskProfessors so naturally I found my way to this subreddit.

If anyone here is inclined to respond with ""there's no such thing as bad professors"", I suggest ignoring my post and moving on. This will be long, so read the TL;DR. 

As the title says, I'm a student who's been serious about my education for my entire life. I try my best, and I approach challenging subjects with tenacity and rigor. I have an A in this class, but I'm close to giving up and just focusing on passing with the bare minimum. 

I've only left one public review on Rate My Professor, entirely positive, for my former physics professor because she deserved it. I don't go out of my way to do stuff like this unless a person is remarkable enough in what they do. My physics professor was excellent. Otherwise, I'm usually neutral or have mutual respect for my professors who seem like they care and try their best. 

The professor I have this semester is late to every lecture, does not teach but reads densely-worded slides for a STEM subject, uses content riddled with mistakes and hair-ripping inconsistencies and material not covered in the lecture, an online ""learning"" system with its own rules and an average of 3 hours to complete.  I understand people have bad days and make mistakes. Some of the best professors I've had made mistakes occasionally. I also understand having rough days. 

As an undergrad, I've went out of my way outside of class to clarify this subject to confused peers when their questions went unanswered or were answered poorly. All of their questions were reasonable and about the material. I took it upon myself to answer those questions outside the class and suggest better material to the students because I saw the light leave their eyes when they became more confused as this professor gave vague, circulatory, passive-aggressive answers. I'm interested in this subject outside of school, and I know a little bit about it to know what's right and wrong. I'm talking about a professor here who cannot answer the most basic questions about a subject matter. It's concerning.

I expect that professors should not only be experts in their subjects, but also know how to teach it in the best possible way to clear fogs in learning rather than make them notoriously more difficult to traverse. I expect professors to want to teach with the intention of wanting students to find joy in learning and make process as smooth as possible, especially when the subject matter is known to be difficult. 

I have to quality control the material at every turn and remind them to post agreed-upon assignments in the online learning system because they forget every single time. I'm done with the passive aggressive remarks when we ask legitimate questions about assignment set-ups and whether the agreed-upon material is available. It's disheartening when a professor does not keep their word on basic things we explicitly agreed upon during the in-person lecture. I dread being there every time.

I'm tired of trying to be understanding. I don't understand. I'm going to provide feedback during the end-of-course evaluations, which are private. I also want to warn future students who care as much as I do to avoid this professor and save their sanity. I'm close to posting a negative review publicly. I know that may not be as threatening as I think it sounds. Some of you may find it comical, *as if a scary* *Rate My Professor review has any impac*t. Fair enough. I know RMP is often filled with disgruntled students wanting to blow off some steam rather than an accurate reflection of professors' abilities. However, I feel like I have a duty to warn students like me, who like learning but don't like putting up with a professor who is clearly indifferent and chooses not to make the learning process easier by keeping their word about assignments and doing the bare minimum. I feel like we are test subjects, bearing of the brunt of mistakes and carelessness and inexperience. It has serious impacts on students who are trying their best.

I just want this professor to do better. I know they can. They've had a couple of great lectures in the sea of confusion and inconsistency. Should I go to office hours and express this to my professor in-person? 

TL;DR: Indifferent professor consistently making mistakes and not keeping their word. What can I do about it? How can I get them to improve so students of future semesters don't struggle needlessly?

"Losing my home","TL;DR:  I am going homeless and I am possibly failing the year. 

Good day all. I am currently going to the Faculty of Humanities in a small uni town in Europe. It is close to my home, and I am usually scared of travel, so I opted to go there and see how things might go. My family raised me with the expectations of being a farmer or someone with a profession, so as a kid that meant that wine or olive oil production were a far higher priority than school, which did not translate well to my grades. I was never a great student, since I failed a class in elementary and always struggled in my education, but things did click during high school. I had high interest in languages, geography and while I wasn't brilliant in history, I did like it. After I graduated, I thus wanted to continue getting myself educated. I first wanted to apply for English and Italian, but my mother scared me away from the latter by claiming my Italian is inadequate, so I chose History instead. First year went quite well, I wasn't stalling with my studies and I made a good group of friends. However, the second year has been anything but pleasant. Trouble began very early In August last year, when my uncle died from cancer, followed by my grandma in September due to lung embolism and the suicide of my aunt in December. I made sure to attend my classes and I was willing to not let it get to me, although I definitely felt a significant burden from the grief I experienced, especially when my aunt died. However, January saw a significant downturn. Due to the death of my grandma, the inheritance of our house was split between my father and his brother (uncle). While at first we were discussing on renovation, uncle quickly began to speak to several people whom I am not familiar with about selling the house, and those talks reached a fever pitch in March when agents came to our house to inspect it and see how much it might be worth. My father tried to prevent him from going for this route, but apparently uncle is in severe debts after losing his job and spending his money on various drugs, and he needs this money bad. In April, the price was put up, and we already have a potential buyer. Because of the house being a 50/50 ordeal, this means that we will be getting a half of the cut. Unfortunately, that cut is likely not enough for us to afford an apartment, and we will soon completely lose our house. Uncle has been barging into our home each night, drunk out of his mind and taking things from our basement, and we have already had several fights over this matter. This has significantly affected my own motivation and mental health, and I have failed several of my exams, and I will likely have to repeat the year if I don't pass my retakes in September. I have spent sleepless nights thinking about the whole ordeal, I have cried myself to sleep multiple times, and I already had a night where I did nothing but drink booze to forget about what is happening in my family. All of us in the family are stressed, and we have had shouting matches almost daily because of the house ordeal, and I can't study properly even for my retakes. The subjects I have to pass are English Semantics (9/11), Syntax (9/10), English modern literature (9/17), European Medieval History (9/1) and Croatian medieval history (9/3). I am not sure if I am able to prepare adequately for all of the subjects, and I am honestly feeling trapped because of the situation at home. I wanted to take a pause, but I was so close to finishing classes that I wanted to persevere, yet now I feel like I should have just taken a gap year. I feel scared for the future of my family the most, because we are so close to losing our livelihood, and I feel betrayed by my uncle, whom I feel like I do not know anymore. I am trying to stay calm, but it is really, really hard. Please, any advice is welcome.

"My friends never last and I need help","Hi guys, I'm a rising junior in college and all I've seen that my friends have all fizzled out. I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong because I always reach out to people, and while I would have some response, it never sticks. For one reason or another, almost every friend I've met has either left or we have just fizzled out. Me and a friend decided to stop talking last year and because of this I distanced myself from our mutual friends (I realized after that most of my friends were her friends, but not my friends). I made some a new friend this semester, but no matter how much I reach out to her, she never responses. The same thing happened with my older friends.

I really want to leave college with atleast some solid friends (3-5?) that I can continue to talk with and I don't think that amount is large. I'd appreciate some help on what to do as I've already followed the typical advice-- joining new clubs, going to new places, inviting people I'm not close with to hang out. I

In studying neuro, I had intended to complete a PhD and attempt to break into pharma somewhere down the line. English, however - I couldn't be more obsessed with it (and have been since childhood), and (if all goes well) I'll be completing an undergraduate thesis and mayyybe a PhD in English (I genuinely really want to, but if it's either academia, the prospects for which are pretty abysmal right now, or being overqualified for jobs, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Still might do it, though lol). Thing is, I'll have accumulated about $130k worth of student loan debt upon graduating, and my parents cosigned my loans. I'm actually scared out of my wits that I'll be delinquent and they'll have to bear responsibility. Also, I'm not sure if I can re-add my neuroscience concentration at this point - I'm only halfway through its requirements either way - or if I even want to.

Right now I just want to rant and cry my heart out. I tried so hard in high school and even got into a uni which was literally the best choice for my major and it‚Äôs perfect for me in every way but because of the location I would have to pay over 40k a year just to attend which is so much more frustrating bc I was born and raised in that state. Alright fine well that dream is gone and my dad wanted me to stay close anyway so I decided to just go to an average state school but even when I felt like I was settling, they gave me a slap on the face with the 20k tuition which is insane for being in-state.

"Telling my AP that I want to change my major...","Previously a Architectural Engineering Major (I chose this major because my dad told me to pick a major that would pay me 65000+, and it was also what I was mildly interested in) going to a community college, I want to change to Psychology. I hated AE for 2 years (been going for 3) and am supposed to transfer to another college next semester. My parents also want me to apply for an intership this summer. Truth is, I loved Psychology (interest started in Middle School, peaked in Highschool) and want to get a connected degree (Human Services to Psychology). I also have ADHD, so it's harder to concentrate and complete assignments on time (sometimes I need reread a page dozens of times to understand it). I also noticed that I was so interested in it that I didn't burn out during the middle of the semester like I usually do and managed to hold until the last two weeks where I slowed down (still passed). 

My APs hate each other and only stay together for my younger brothers (youngest is 10). My AF is emotional distant with my mom (also his mother treated my mom badly and he did nothing). My AM hates that my father (who works 7 days a week 8-10 hours) doesn't do considerate things (washing dishes, loading dishwasher, etc.).

My AF is already mad that I'm taking longer than the ""needed"" years (taking 5 years instead of 4) to finish my study (they don't understand that credits are what counts the most). My AM mentioned a few times that once I graduate, to get an apartment and take her away from my AF. Though, she (probably calmed down after seeing the rent prices) hasn't mentioned it for months. 

For reference, my mental health got so bad last year (summer through fall semester), that I got suicidal to runaway to deciding to stay after speaking to a counselor (college provides mental health service). There's also finances to consider. My father constantly asked if I applied for a loan (which I have not done yet). I was planning to pay it through, semester tuition is 2000-2500 for full-time students. There is also the fact that they want me to take 4 classes a semester, something I now understand that I really can't manage, 3 is my max. But they refuse to learn about or see the symptoms of ADHD.

I know I can't delay this much longer and need to tell them. My original plan was to email or text them this information while I was at work or something. Since I've been keeping this to myself, my anxiety and stress level is through the roof.

"how do I distinguish my academic failures from my own personal self worth?","I've posted here before about constantly failing my classes or even training programs, and im wondering how do you guys cope with failing? the reason why I ask this is because,

I genuinely can't see myself as not being an utter failure when I cant pass quizzes, or don't understand the assignments. I even argued with my therapist about it cause, yes im grateful for the job stability I have now, got my license finally after years of trying, yet I still feel like a massive loser because every failure along the way has been marked onto me and I cant Help but be reminded of them all whenever I attempt college. I was in college for 4 years and never made it to the second semester of my program cause I couldnt get a B in most of the classes, so I tried only doing 1 class and I still failed, I tried a workforce program in my college and failed that as well. Now im just feeling stuck and stupid because no job pays more than I already make without requiring a certificate, degree, or experience. Like, How do you not feel like a failure after everything you try doesn't work? sorry for the rant

"Please be blunt with me‚Äì do I have a shot at getting into a good graduate school program? (LONG post)","I'd ask r/college, but they delete everything when I talk about my mental health. Fair warning for mentions of suicide, drugs, and abuse. I won't be going into too much detail, because that's gruesome.

So, when I hit high school, my mom turned to drugs which made her violent and abusive (to the point I had to worry about my life). This screwed over my high school GPA, which was a 2.4 (weighted).

So I went to community college, broke and unprepared, because I needed to get out of that abusive household. But because I was so unprepared, I failed all of my classes my first semester. I was also hospitalized for mental health reasons that semester, which caused me to give up and fail.

I retook all of my classes next semester and ended up getting around a 3.2~ish? So, not bad. Nothing below a B-. I did finish this semester, but around April after my finals, I attempted suicide. I lived (duh), but I never told anyone until a year later and I never went to the hospital for it, so nobody knew. All of my credits taken so far have been for either my biology major or general education. Nothing related to my current major.

I continued through online college, and decided to transfer when I had around a 3.0. Really not great, but not that bad. I transferred to a university that wasn't my first choice, but it was better than nothing. I was an animation major (I had no clue what I was doing, and I really thought an animation degree from a mediocre Midwest university would get me somewhere), so a lot of my credits from here were related to animation.

That year (2023/2024) I got hospitalized twice (both times during finals) for mental health reasons. I got a 3.889, though!

I decided to come back home to online college to finish up my associate's degree I never finished. I retook a class I initially failed (it was during my previous online period) because it was just a hard ass class, but I retook it and got a C. Hardest class I've ever taken and it was a level 200 gen-ed run by a guy who was disappointed his life never went the direction he wanted it to go. Anyways. I also got a good grade in my other class and bumped my GPA up to a 3.208.

Got my associate's degree now, finished last December and decided to take the spring semester off to save money for another school I wanted to transfer to. During the summer and fall of that year, I was hospitalized twice. During the fall and the winter of that year, I ""attempted suicide"" twice (I wasn't faking, I just don't know what else to call it and I don't want to get into details). Making three attempts in total. I was diagnosed with bipolar II after my third attempt (I also got diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD previously, but these didn't affect me as much).

I talk about all of this even though it's really hard for me because I believe it's essential to my story and who I am. I don't know how much I can talk about on college applications, which absolutely sucks. If I go too into detail, I'm seen as a burden and asking for pity. But that's not what I'm doing and I know for a fact I'm not a burden.

Anyways, today I have a combined 3.495 GPA, and I'm transferring to a local university much closer to my dad, that way I have support if something bad happens. But, with medications and being properly diagnosed, my hopes are high. I'm currently going to aim for a 3.9/4.0 (although as long as I have a 3.2+, I'll be okay, as that's the requirement for completion of the honors program). And the reason I'm so positive I might be able to aim this high is because if I can get a 3.5 unmedicated (with bipolar disorder, I need to stress, because that is a BITCH to live with undiagnosed) and unsupported, I think I can get even higher with proper medication and proper support.

I'm now going into marketing (I'm positive I'll stay with my major this time, because I told myself if I don't like it that's too bad), and I'm actually really excited for my classes. So, my first goal is to get a 3.9/4.0 (although I won't beat myself up if I don't get this!), and graduate with a couple internships under my belt. Next, I plan on working for a couple of years (needed for an MBA) while studying for my GMAT (my ideal score is 700+, again, won't beat myself up if I don't get this), and after my MBA and a couple of years with that, I want to get my doctorate and eventually become a professor. I'd also ideally maybe work with nonprofits.

Anyways, now that that spiel is out of the way, let's say these for a couple of examples: I get my ideal GPA of a 3.9, and I get a 730 on my GMAT exam (because I am going to study like a sonofabitch for it), I got good essays (maybe related to my personal experience, maybe not), I explain in my application that I had medical issues preventing me from reaching my full potential. I am also a female coming from an impoverished area, with parents who are both disabled. I am also first-gen, female, and white. I got good extracurriculars under my belt (including working since I was 16), as well as a couple of years (lets say two as the minimum) of relevant work.

I'm fine with getting into a small, nameless school for my MBA (if I choose that as my master's instead of something else). But that's not what I want. I want something that'll impress people. If I get the statistics I previously mentioned, I'll be applying to M7s. I do not expect to get into these M7s, but I'll beat myself up if I don't apply. More realistically, I'll be applying to T25s, preferably the University of Michigan. I'm looking for a fully covered tuition, or at least, half covered.

Be honest and blunt with me, what do I say on my applications, and what are my chances?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1li37jg/please_be_blunt_with_me_do_i_have_a_shot_at/","1750639070.0","CollegeRant","None"
"College has been nothing but pain","First off, I want to say that I'm in community college, so maybe that's why I'm experiencing the issues I‚Äôm about to vent about in this post. I'm a second-year student and will soon transfer to a four-year university. My experience with college has been horrible, and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one because no one else I talk to seems to be having the same experience.

Let‚Äôs start with the classes.

1. The professors suck. They don‚Äôt seem to care about us or the course itself. It feels like they just show up to collect a paycheck. Most of them teach by reading off crappy PowerPoints ‚Äî the kind they could‚Äôve just uploaded online ‚Äî but instead, they waste an hour reading them out loud and call it a day. Then they assign work that‚Äôs almost completely unrelated to the slides. I honestly wish I could get paid thousands of dollars just to read slides. Nice to know where my tuition money is going.


2. The students are assholes. I‚Äôve never met so many rude or fake people in one place. There are basically two types: people who don‚Äôt want anything to do with you, and people who just want to use you ‚Äî either for favors or something else. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone genuine. It‚Äôs also really hard to make new friends. The clubs at my school are worthless, and the people who do go to them are already in tight friend groups. I‚Äôve been to three different clubs ‚Äî big ones, like the gaming club and anime club ‚Äî and the average attendance is like four or five people. So I gave up. At this point, I‚Äôm more isolated than a prisoner.


3. College takes up so much time, and time is money  and I‚Äôm broke. To top it off, I‚Äôm not even sure I want to continue with my major. Thanks to some terrible teachers, I‚Äôve come to hate accounting, which is kind of ironic since it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm studying.



So to recap: the teaching sucks, the social life is nonexistent, and I‚Äôve grown to hate my major. Why am I even doing this?

I‚Äôm halfway through, so now I just feel obligated to keep going. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, because everyone else ‚Äî even people at my school ‚Äî don‚Äôt seem to have these issues. I didn‚Äôt expect college to be perfect, but the fact that I can honestly say I had better education in high school is wild.


TL;DR: The education sucks, the social life really sucks, and college is making me more miserable than I‚Äôve ever been.

"My parents make $0 and seeing other student's parents paying $200k+ for their tuition makes me sad","My parents are both disabled‚Äì the only reason they have a place to live is because our grandma lets us live at her house for almost completely free. But even before they became disabled, my dad was a roofer and my mom was a factory worker, so they weren't making anything spectacular.

My mom did have a small savings before she became disabled ($10k), which was a LOT to us, but she ended up blowing it all on drugs. That's the ""richest"" we've ever been.

I make more than my parents at $14/hr as a food clerk at Meijer. I do have a savings of $8.5k, currently. I am also in a lot of medical debt due to lots of psychiatric hospitalizations (maybe 7 or 8?). I currently have a collection marked as a derogatory on my credit score because I couldn't even afford $10/mo at the time it was given to me. (I completely forgot about this debt, and I have received nothing in the mail about it being in collections... I plan on calling them to see if I can resolve this, but I doubt it).

I went to community college to save money, but it ended up kind of screwing me over, as every university in the state doesn't offer free tuition towards transfer students (except for the University of Michigan, which is not only on the other side of the state, but I got screwed over because the dad I DO NOT LIVE WITH and get NO assistance from technically has assets over $120k, even though he makes $50k/yr). Grand Valley State did offer free tuition for transfers until last year. All these cool programs about free community college were not there when I graduated in 2021.

I have $15k in student loans (I'm in year four of college). Not great, not horrible. I'm saving my money so I'll be able to pay it off.

I'm awaiting to see if I won an $11,000 transfer student scholarship at my university.

Even with the full Pell grant, the full amount of loans, FSEOG grant, and scholarships and grants from the university and from outside scholarships, I still have to pay $5,000 out of pocket (hence why I'm awaiting to see if I won this scholarship). Good news is I'll get tuition reimbursement from Meijer, so this should go back in my pocket.

I just saw a post on r/FAFSA about a student who was a full blown millionare talking about his FAFSA. He proceeded to go into the comments and make insulting comments about poor families, as if it's our choice to be poor. This really hurt.

It also reminds me of the multiple times fellow students will come up to me asking ""what do your parents do?"" and I have to tell them every time that they're disabled and make literally nothing. People act shocked (albeit all of them have been supportive), but it makes me feel so out of place.

And I'm going to be real for a second, I am 100% envious of students who can afford to go to ivy leagues out of pocket and live in luxury apartments because of their parent's pockets. And sometimes seeing these people pisses me off, even when it shouldn't. I know better than to be angry, because it's good to see that somebody is succeeding in the world and has supportive parents, but at the same time, I can't really help it.

But mostly it just makes me feel really sad. I wish I grew up with more money. I wish my mom wasn't a drug addict. I wish my parents weren't disabled (for both their sake and mine). I feel so out of place sometimes.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lgldgx/my_parents_make_0_and_seeing_other_students/","1750471562.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Living home with my toxic dad","Hello guys. I'm currently a sophomore doing my summer classes. I recently withdrew from an intro to Philosophy course. To get straight to the point, basically I was super overwhelmed from the online class and simply the online class just didn't feel right to me so guys I thought withdrawing the course was good to save my GPA and that's what I did. I withdrew from the course. Fast forward, when I had this conversation with my dad that I withdrew from this course, he literally cursed me out and called me an a-hole for not asking for help and like he was so unhappy and so frustrated. Like I want a nice GPA even if it comes at a hard choice of withdrawing an online summer course like that. Withdrawing courses is not easy but I had to do it to save my GPA. Sorry if I sound like a neurotic kid but my GPA is 3.47 right now cumulative. I'm a chemistry major. A couple of things I didn't find right was that online courses are generally not suitable to me and the pace felt a bit too quick. I'm more of a slow learner when it comes to philosophy. I was simply overwhelmed with work guys. 

He cursed me out and made me feel so bad about myself, like yes dad I'm trying hard but sometimes I'm too overwhelmed to ask for help. HE LITERALLY SAID I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'M (MOSTLY) GETTING As and Bs IN MY OTHER COURSES!!! I EVEN TOLD HIM THAT BUT HE DISMISSED MY EFFORTS. For context, he pays the tuition of my university so he kind of has a right to intervene and ask me. That also pushes me to the halfway point always, should I move out and actually live my life I want in a college out of town but have to deal with not-so-healthy college foods and have to eat out at Chipotle or something to satisfy my hunger. I don't know man, he has been like this since when I was a young kid. But no hate to my dad, I love my dad so much and I will continue to love him but at the same time, man you gotta acknowledge my efforts. Anyway guys, what can I do in this situation guys? I am typing this at night so I may not be able to reply to you instantly but I might reply in the morning. 

  
TL;DR: My dad called me an a-hole and cursed me out and didn't acknowledge my mental health at all, I even communicated my efforts and yeah sometimes I got overwhelmed. I even communicated my efforts but he dismissed those efforts and even threatened me that if I continue down this road, expect me to call you (aka me) an even worse curse word.

"I ruined my GPA in a span of six weeks","I can't believe it. I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I was one of the few people whose marks actually went up from high school to uni. I decided to (stupidly) take two accelerated, online, six-week summer courses that spanned from early May to about now. I knew I was burnt out by the end of April, but the only reason I took those courses was to not be viewed as ""an unproductive loser"" (because I didn't apply to a summer job, and I was discouraged to as well, by my parents) by my household. I think I failed both courses.

I don't know what happened to me. I felt so unmotivated and procrastinated a lot during them. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought of doing a withdrawal from both but I didn't, because I thought I could push through. Now it's a stain on my transcript forever. I think I failed both. One of those courses is related to my major (economics), an intermediate level one, and now I'm discouraged that maybe I should switch majors. Despite me getting A's in the introductory courses and having a genuine passion for the subject. I'm devastated. I think this will only further my depression. I don't even know what I can blame; my laziness or depression. I may not even have depression; I may be unknowingly just using it as an excuse to mask my laziness. My parents are consoling me but I feel ashamed of myself. It's a nightmare.

I have no one to blame by the way. The professors were good, and the tests were fair. I only have myself to blame.

I knew I'd mess up at something. It seemed too good to be true that I had a 3.7 in my first year, given I've had one struggle after another since like 2022 (mainly personal/mental issues). I thought something was finally looking up for my life. But I was wrong. I'm back to square one. When I graudated high school last year and started university I had pledged to myself that I'd do well, and that university would be a ""fresh start"" after the worst 4 years of my life which was high school. Now I'm back to square one. Wow.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfqoyp/i_ruined_my_gpa_in_a_span_of_six_weeks/","1750379833.0","CollegeRant","ReactionWater7016"
"I was the crazy roommate back in 2023‚Äì it was horribly embarrassing and shameful","MASSIVE trigger warning for suicide.
I don't really know if this is a rant as much as it is ruminating about something terrible. I would talk about it on r/college, but that'd be a guaranteed post being taken down and/or ban. I guess I just need to open up about this.

So I was 20 and I lived with 18 years olds, we met on Facebook and decided to be roommates on-campus for 2023/2024. They seemed really cool.

We got along VERY well (in fact, my roommate had a crush on me, but of course I didn't initiate because I didn't want to date an 18 year old lmfao). We were very close friends.

Well, a couple months in, things started to sour a bit. One of our roommates was irritating everybody else. I had disagreements about how to do the chores (I don't even remember what it was about clearly), and I tried explaining this clearly quite a few times, they just never really got it (or they chose to ignore it).

They did quite a few things that pissed me off, and I do believe that they didn't like me because I disagreed with how to do chores and I was open about it. They were very messy roommates (got warned for their messiness right before I left, left shitty underwear on the counter, garbage everywhere, dirty dishes, used period pads in the shower...) and that irritated me. They expected me to pick up after them, basically.

They started being more and more cold to me as time went on. We started to dislike each other, two of my roommates started to gang up against me and my other roommate.

I'm very stressed out about my grades around this time, and I never told anybody, but I was deeply struggling with suicidal thoughts. When my roommates were gone, I would scream and curse to myself because of how stressed out I was (I was losing it, yes). My roommate did find a suicide note I left at one point, to which I just kind of... apologized to the best of my abilities, and I told her I was okay. She was actually pretty kind about it. She invited me to have tea and talk about fun stuff with her.

I was going crazy by this point. My thoughts made no sense and were very jumbled. I was barely stable in classes, but I did resemble a bit of sanity to the point people outside of my roommates thought I was normal.

I told my residence hall director what was going on. I was afraid to talk to my RA because I knew they'd want to have a group chat with my roommates, and I was afraid to confront them and be singled out even more. He just kind of sighed, made a little comment about not going to the RA, and he didn't really do much. He didn't take me seriously at all, obviously.

Time passes, and we eventually get into a big argument in the group chat. I don't remember about what other than chores and me feeling ganged up on. I was slamming doors and kicking stuff. Eventually, my roommate awkwardly comes into the bedroom and ignores me, and I guess I just kind of snapped. I muttered ""I can't do this anymore"" and grabbed all of my medication and went into the bathroom.

By this point, I took my phone and I called 988, because a small part of me recognized that I was not okay and I needed help. I ended up screaming and sobbing. I was minutes away from downing every pill I had and drinking a combination of all the chemicals I had around me. Fortunately, 988 called the police on me, and so did my roommates, because I think they suspected that something was deeply wrong. A roommate did knock on the door and ask if I was okay, to which I replied yes (I wasn't).

Of course, the police show up along with the person working at the front desk at the time, and I'm taken away to a cop car to the hospital where I was involuntarily admitted for about a week.

By this point, I thought I just had major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. I did have a suicide attempt about a year or two before this.

A week passes and I'm taken back to campus right as finals were about to happen. Great news, my residence hall director emailed me telling me there was an opening in the building, and there was another person seeking out a roommate because of their bad roommate situation. I did have to spend another night at my old dorm, and it was a little awkward, but it was calm. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about it.

Eventually, I did move out. It was awkward and silent between my roommates as I was packing up. My roommate did offer to help me pack very kindly. I refused the help, but I did thank her. And then I moved three floors down.

My new roommate was awesome. We did have a ""disagreement"" on how to do chores, in the sense that we had different ideas of what to do, but we came up with a scenario that worked for both of us very quickly and easily, they were very understanding and nice. We got along just fine for the rest of the year.

I did run into my roommates twice. One time, we ran into each other while I was leaving the dining hall. We smiled at each other and I opened the door for her, and she said thank you. Another time, my roommate left my stuff in a bag by my door that I forgot to pack with a note that said ""Have a great summer :)"", I emailed her thanking her and telling her to have a great summer back. And that was the last we heard from each other.

After this, I transferred back to my community college (partially out of embarrassment) and lived at home while I got my associate's degree (which I earned last December, and then I took the winter semester off). I attempted suicide two more times, and went to the hospital involuntarily three more times.

So, um... yeah, I was the crazy roommate. And I feel just horrible. I mean, really, really bad (as I should). I think I traumatized my freshman year roommates. I don't care how mean they were being towards me at the moment, what I did wasn't okay. But I didn't know what else to do. I was losing my mind.

And what breaks my heart even more is that they were so nice to me about it later. I did meet a friend of my roommate after that incident, and she told me that my roommate spoke about the incident and me poorly, but I really deserve that and I'm okay with that. I almost wish they weren't nice to me about it at all. I think they understood that I wasn't quite all there.

I think the only reason I wasn't academically dismissed is because I did tell my RHD I was struggling a couple of times, and my dad called the college and explained the situation/my mental health. I did have to talk to the student success center and keep visiting them. Trust me, I wouldn't have gone to college and gotten roommates if I knew my mental health was going to be that bad.

Later on (just about 6 months ago actually), I got diagnosed with bipolar II, not MDD. Which explains (but doesn't excuse) the crazy behavior. I'm finally properly medicated. I'm not even suicidal anymore, and I feel genuinely happy, even with the downsides in my life.

I'm returning to in-person college this fall. I am going to have my own personal bedroom, but three suitemates (couldn't afford a single bedroom), but please don't worry. If something bad happens, I only live 20 minutes away from my dad at this university and can stay with him, and I am much more prepared to tackle things this time due to being properly medicated.

So, um... yeah. I was the crazy roommate. And I hate it so much. I feel so guilty (like I should). I guess I just needed to talk about it and open up about it. I wish I could email my previous roommates and apologize, but I think it's better if I left it alone. Like I said, I guess I just need to open up about it. If you read this far, I appreciate it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfjc5m/i_was_the_crazy_roommate_back_in_2023_it_was/","1750360389.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Halfway done with college since last month and it's been a total shitshow","My college experience has been ruined by my shitty immigrant parents and mental illnesses. I knew the steps I needed to change but I just spiraled due to being scared and depressed and I blame myself for it

Firstly, I hate my parents a lot. My neurodivergence was a huge issue, but they made everything worse. They're Indian immigrant parents too by the way. They ruined the first 20 years of my life. They literally abused me a lot as a kid both physically and emotionally for the dumbest shit ever too, they just put pressure and expectations on me, they literally control and shelter me even at 20 and treat me like a fucking child and restrict me from freedom a normal teenager gets in the USA, and I'm pretty sure they only had my little brother and I so we take care of them when they're old or to see us as an extension of themselves. 

They got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis sometime in second to fourth grade, but didn't tell me until 7th grade just because I was too young. Hiding a diagnosis is one thing, but they constantly made me feel like a failure for those stuff and abused me. They KNEW the fucking reasons why I struggled with academics and social situations, had odd specific interests, struggled with attention span and comprehension, why I had to take special ed, why I had to take ABA therapy, why a doctor forced me on a gluten and dairy free diet in third grade and forced me to take some meds, and still fucking treated me like a failure and a bad kid. And until 11th grade, they absolutely REFUSED to get me a psychiatrist or meds. They don't understand my ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression at all and sometimes even downplay my struggles. 

Like they're overall shitty parents. They force me to adhere to Indian culture when I don't connect with it at all and also force Hinduism and some ridiculous superstitions on me when I am personally not religious and they believe you should blindly follow these stuff no matter what and take them very seriously. 

Both of them are narcissists, but my mom even more so because she has almost every textbook trait of a narcissist, so she is generally worse. 

I hate how they say they ""give us everything we want"" and even say they're more lenient than other parents when all they did was give a few toys and stuff for gaming we want and pay for college and expenses which is the fucking bare minimum. They even brag about the BARE bare minimum like giving birth, raising us, wiping our asses, food, clothes etc. 

They say we're the ones who are seeing them as villains and not communicating our feelings and assuming they'll say no, but it's straight bullshit. 

They don't give a shit about anything I like. In elementary school, I loved lego sets and after 5th grade, they stopped buying them just because that was the only thing I bought and they thought I was too old. Even for my 11th birthday with my OWN allowance and birthday money when I wanted to buy a $120 lego set, they didn't let me for that stupid reason. In high school, I was passionate about gaming and even wanted to go pro or make content, but even on summer break, they only let me play 1.5 hours on weekends. And even now in college they're controlling. Like last year when I picked apartment housing for sophomore year, they fucking made me screen share and made me put reqs as no beef, no drinking, no smoking. Im still forced to follow religion and culture blindly, they force me to go on vacations with them or dumb gatherings with family friends. Like I'm 20 for fucks sake and still treated like 12. 

They have high expectations and think anything below a 3.5 is a bad GPA and they say we're lucky they don't expect 4.0. 

They just use the ""give everything you want"" and ""we pay for college and everything"" lines as leverage to control us and later use it in the future. They literally made us study in breaks and only care about us being successful.

Secondly, I hate myself for having ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression. ADHD and Autism fucking ruined my life since childhood. Like I said, it made me struggle academically and socially, made me mentally immature and behind, and have weird interests.Those weird interests made it hard for me to connect with people my age that since middle school, I withdrew myself completely because people became more judgy. While they were into normal interests like sports, pop culture, and TV shows better for their age group, I was still into shows considered childish and toys and even that way in high school. 

My anxiety and depression started in 6th grade too. I was even delusional until 12th grade just every day wishing for some magic powers, which is stupid I know, but it happened and one of the reasons I ruined my life. I did read that child abuse affects amygdala and hippocampus, which increases risk of anxiety and depression, which is probably why I have those two. 

Because of my parents and mental illnesses, I literally missed out on 20 years of my life and experiences like friends, partying, sports, dating, sex, being popular, having a fake ID etc.. Combine that with my parents pressuring me to get out of comfort zone and shell all the,  making friendships and socializing feel draining, and not assimilating to US culture and teaching us how to be socially successful just made me avoid everything. 

It also doesn't help that everyone these days also says that being shy, having no friends, and not fitting in is okay when that's the reason why most of my generation sucks. 

Fast forward to now where I halfway finished college a month ago and it's been an absolute shitshow. I'm at ASU and ever since I stepped foot in it on day 1, my life became much worse. I was placed with outgoing roommates who love to party. That was when I hated myself for how I was and wanting to be introverted when I kept hiding. Like I remember even one hot girl liked me and I didn't believe it. 

After that semester, I wanted to party but I realized you have to be in a frat to party. I wasn't confident enough to rush and then missed out and said I would do it the first sem of sophomore year. Just being lonely and dwelling on the past so much made me more miserable and spiral more that my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 3.59 and just rot more. 

But I did NOTHING to improve myself and just waited and then it came and I got no bids from the houses I rushed. You'd think I'd improve myself this time, but I fell in a worse spiral and tanked my GPA  to a 3.46 instead, even skipped classes for a whole month, and even had a shitty diet and worked out less. Then 4th sem came and this time same shit. It sucked because I actually tried this time and was more social and cracked jokes and everyone was gassing me up and even in one of the other frats I knew 4 guys from freshman year and 3 of them had exec positions and even acknowledged my change, yet I didn't get in a SINGLE invite only event. It sucks because sophomore year is generally the last time to rush. I know I could've gotten in a bottom house and still can in junior year because they bid anyone, but I hate them because they're like 40 members at most and all rejects who only joined because they were rejected from actual frats just for the sake of being in one, but they're still irrelevant. 

I know most people go to bars instead of frat parties and frat parties are usually off campus, but I really wanted this shit since second semester of college to meet a lot of people quickly and be popular and that's what I based my whole identity on to get in those specific frats. Even though people still tell me I can make a few drinking buddies and a girl and even if people drift after college, it sucks ass at the moment not being in a frat, especially under 21. 

I literally vowed that if i get a bid, I'd start getting my shit together.And it does seem like many people who party are in the frats I just hated everyone in greek life since then and hated people in general. The decent frats are mostly people who have been ready since HIGH SCHOOL. Many of them are even PROUD of being exclusive, but I bet a lot of them never had to deal with neurodivergence or a shitty upbringing. It sucked how they straight up gassed me up and cut me early. I'd rather have been straight up INSULTED and beaten up and thrown out rather than whatever the fuck that was. I hope a day comes where I get to beat these people up because after this rejection from the frats when it was my last chance to rush, I don't have a chance at the most optimal college experience possible.

I don't wanna join a club or just talk to people in classes because clubs are for nerds and nothing like frats. And I DO wanna party which most of these losers online are against. That semester was the worst that I even failed a class and tanked to a 3.29. I hate being told to just make the best out of everything. I was too scared coming from abuse and being sheltered and neurodivergence into college and anxious to talk to people because they wouldn't like me. This frat shit was the only shit I wanted in college and I have no chance anymore. 

My life gets worse every year, but ever since I started college, it's been much worse. I just hate myself for my fucked up mind making me miss out on everything. 

I don't know if I'll ever have a college experience as I hoped. I fucking hate this place and can't wait to graduate. I'm just so bitter and resentful towards the people having what I have and towards the people who excluded me. I hate my parents for not knowing how to be good parents and not assimilating to US culture and learning how to be cool. I hate myself for constantly spiraling and blowing up the last chance at rush. Sure I can get some drinking buddies and a girl and most people go to bars when older, but it won't feel the same as being in a frat.

"I shouldve never listened to my sister and now idk how to twll her about my choice for community college","Hi. I am a recently graduated high school student who was persuaded into applying to UC Merced instead of going to CSU Chico. I was dead set on going to Chico and even excited to see a brand new part of California even if it meant leaving my family far away. My sister pushed me to the only UC I got accepted to because ‚ÄúUCs have better education compared to CSUs‚Äù So I withdrew from Chico and thought I wanted to go to Merced even though they didn‚Äôt have the major of my choice (rlly dumb ik) sooo I was like ‚ÄúI GUESS ill go because UCs are better and I‚Äôll become a pharmacist instead of registered dietitian‚Äù So I attended Bobcat Day and explored UC Merced. Although the campus is nice, it was in the middle of no where and js not rlly catching my eye. But I still forced myself to like it because my sister arranged this JUST for me and spent a good amount of money along with my dad. After some heavy consideration, I didn‚Äôt want to be away from my mom. I know it‚Äôs nice to give yourself some experience away from home but I realized I am too young/I have no experience. And my mom is moving to houston at the end of the year so I was like ‚ÄúI rlly hate UC Merced, I‚Äôll just go to community college js so I would be close to home, save money and get into a school I actually want to go to.‚Äù Altho many people dunk on CC, I think it‚Äôs a great pathway for those unsure of what they want to do with their lives. I would rather go to a CC and not know what I want than go to a university and force myself to do a major that isn‚Äôt what I want. However I have yet to tell my sister. She helped me get house (for free) and helped me through all the admissions. I just know she is going to be pissed off once she learns that I don‚Äôt wanna go to university for the full 4 years. And I want to go to CC. She looks heavily down on CC (even tho she went to one and transfered to UCSB) and told me to at least go to UC Merced for one year even though I told her that is not what I want. I feel extremely controlled by my sister and it‚Äôs giving me stress thinking about how angry she will learn that I want to be near my mom. I shouldve js picked a community college from the beginning instead of a university i dont even like.
And even though financial aid covered for a lot of my stuff, I still have no interest in UC Merced. 
I rlly wanna go to Purdue, UCSB, University of Maryland, GWU, UCSD, Texas A&M or even UCLA if the chance comes around!

(Im sorry if this is missing details or more context is needed, I can give more in the comments)

What I am asking is how should I approach her about it and what if she tries to convince me to go to a University I didn‚Äôt like just because she never was able to do the full 4 years?

"If I medically withdrew from college, how likely am I to be accepted at a new one?","
Hello everyone,

I graduated high school in 2017. My parents told me at the time that they would help pay for college *if* I chose a Christian college. I ended up choosing Colorado Christian University and was accepted. I started in their 2017 fall semester. 

For reasons that would take far too much time to explain (suppressed queer identity, *nasty* break-up, etc), I ended up *severely* depressed during just that first semester. So much so that I was skipping classes and even skipping *midterms.* Obviously, my GPA tanked. Professors and advisors reached out to try and help, and I blew them all off with excuses about 'family emergencies, work, blah blah' whatever bullshit excuse I could think of, anything but admit that I was incredibly suicidal. 

A short time later, I was put on Financial Aid Hold, which is was alerted my parents to the situation. I finally told the professors and advisors the truth about my situation, and they pretty unanimously suggested I Medically Withdraw from school. After a few counselling sessions, that is what I did. 

  
Now, here I am, years later, with no degree and wanting to go back to school. I'm worried, however, about my chances of being accepted to a new school with my record. Do any of the aforementioned things impact my likelihood of being accepted, or impact my likelihood of receiving financial aid? If so, is there anything I can do to.... 'fix' it? What are my options?

___


Edit: (unnecessary little vent, entirely irrelevant to the main point of my post ‚Äî just reflecting back):


It‚Äôs really daunting and frustrating to be 26, and finally begin to realize just how much my choices as an 18 year old are still messing with my future today. I have grace and kindness for that 18 year old ‚Äî they were an absolute wreck, confused, lonely, angry, careless. But that 18 year old also pretty royally messed up their own future. I wish I had taken a gap year rather than jump right into college at 18 when I wasn‚Äôt even sure I *wanted* to go to college; I wish I‚Äôd been honest with my professors right when the trouble started, because maybe then there would have been the chance to save my grades. Frankly, I wish I‚Äôd never chosen CCU lol, for a lot of other reasons. 

Because now, it feels as though that angry and sad little teen burned all my bridges. And in this economy, even people *with* degrees are struggling to find work ‚Äî so it probably comes as no surprise that I‚Äôve been out of work for a year now, despite endless applications and attempts at finding *anything.* 

It‚Äôs strange, because 18 year old me definitely didn‚Äôt expect there would ever *be* a 26 year old me. I wasn‚Äôt concerned for my future, because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have one. Now, im in that kid‚Äôs future, wishing I‚Äôd done so many things differently.

"Is finishing college completely at 26 bad?","I'm making this post for advice and to vent but just right now my aunt asked me when I'll be done with school and I said that I'm going to be at community college for 3 years, and transfer to another college for another 4 years most likely. Also, I know it's usually 2 years, but I don't want to pressure myself, so I just extended it for myself and to do take more electives, is that bad too?

"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here.

"Why aren‚Äôt AP scores seen as greater/equal importance to SAT/ACT scores?","I'm a rising senior, and I've been facing a dilemma with my current ACT score. I scored a 27. It's not a terrible score, but I don't necessarily believe it fully demonstrates my academic abilities. In contrast, my AP scores are objectively stellar. I have taken six AP exams thus far and scored 5's on 5 of them (Bio, World History, Human Geography, APUSH, and Language and Composition) and a 4 on AP Calculus AB. I was originally going to submit the 27 and call it a day, but then I found out that a current senior I knew got into ZERO of the colleges she applied to, and she attributes her rejections to her ACT score of 28. Now it's got me nervous, and now I've been thinking of applying test-optional and submitting all my AP scores instead. Recently, I've been seeing a few posts on this subreddit claim that AP scores DO NOT matter when compared to SAT/ACT scores. Why is that? Both tests accomplish the same thing as standardized tests. Won't a 5 on the APUSH, World History, and Language and Composition exams prove I have college-level reading comprehension and writing skills? Won't a 4 on calculus AB prove that I'm ready for college-level math? I don't understand the double standard.

"Please do not stress ‚Äî advice from a parent.","I do not use this site often, but I recently stumbled on this subreddit. I've noticed that this forum is fraught with emotion, to say the least.

My second son graduated from high school 4 years ago. He was a superb student, scoring 1590 on his SAT and ranking 2nd of 500 students in his class. He was in the Gold division of the USACO, class president, and the programming lead of a robotics team that placed at the world championship. He is also an avid reader of Chinese literature and writes poetry in his free time, about which he wrote his personal statement. 

Despite him being wholly qualified to go just about wherever he wanted, he was rejected by all but three schools he applied to, all of which were ranked outside the top 30. He was incredibly bitter for months afterwards, especially as his two best friends since second grade both committed to Stanford. He saw his rejections as a judgement that he was somehow intellectually inferior than the students that got into top colleges (which is obviously ridiculous, given his top 0.1% IQ and SAT score).

About 18 months ago, he and a friend dropped out of college to found a tech startup that is currently valued in the nine figures, of which he is the Chief Technology Officer and business lead. Even if his current venture fails, I have no doubt whatsoever that he will succeed. He is a very intelligent, extroverted, and ambitious person.

"Why did so many undergrad and Master's programs admit me when I didn't end up doing well? (long post)","My post is going to be a bit unusual because I'm (31M) a 5th year PhD student in Experimental Psychology who is about to finish in August. I did horribly in undergrad (3.25 overall GPA), Master's (3.48), and PhD (no publications and my ratings as a full time instructor on all categories was always 1-2s out of 5. Mostly 1s my last semester). I did my undergrad from 2013-2017 and only took 12-14 credit hours per semester as well since I transferred in 26 credit hours with a 3.71 GPA. I also had a 29 ACT as well with the help of a dedicated ACT tutor (90th something percentile at the time I think. Notably, my math score stayed around 22-24 even though everything else went up), 3.75 unweighted GPA (no weighted courses like AP, IB, or honors. No foreign language courses either since it was a school for dyslexic and/or ADHD students and I graduated with a class of 8). Despite all of that, I bombed hard at the ""stoner school"" of my home state despite getting into their Honor's College (which I dropped out of after I got placed on probation for being below a 3.0 GPA after my second year) and getting a generous merit scholarship. Part of my mistake was taking a BS in Psychology, which required math up to Calc II (which I had to retake before I passed). It was also a big part of the reason I chose the school I did because I would've had to take remedial math courses at my flagship university or other universities if I went to them. I also got into an undergrad with a 25% acceptance rate but I didn't go since it was too expensive, even with their merit scholarship and my family didn't qualify for needs based financial aid at all. I only got through the lab courses despite taking in zero information as well because I coasted off of others in my class. I only had one summer's worth of lab experience as well as one year back my senior year of high school.

My parents also paid for a life coach who helped me through all four years of undergrad and (eventually) a different coach who helped me with graduate program applications. It's worth noting that I have autism and other neurodivergent conditions too (ADHD-I, motor dysgraphia, 3rd percentile processing speed) and mental health (social anxiety at the time of undergrad. I later got diagnosed with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent, and PTSD at 29) so I had accommodations in undergrad other than a note taker for me because I was scared of getting exposed by other students. Internalized ableism at the time also played a role too no doubt since I was afraid of looking like I wasn't doing the work or something to other students. I had 1.5x extended time, quiet room, and allowed to type instead of write on quizzes and/or exams. It's worth noting that my evaluator as a kid listed my autism severity as moderate with supports, but severe without supports based on my lack of ability to manage internal and external distractions, stress, and organization. My self direction is also listed as below average. Studying would also take forever for me usually, so I didn't work during undergrad at all whatsoever.

I only got through my Master's and PhD programs by working with my cohort a lot as well as using notes during what should've been closed note closed book exams for two difficult classes during COVID. There was no Lockdown Browser to keep up accountability so everyone did what I did. Not saying it's right but just putting that out there. I wasn't a good student in my classes nor did I ever work on multiple projects at a time. I was also the only one in my cohort who had a 10 hour assistantship my second year. Everyone else went up to 20 hours because they took a 1 credit hour course to TA their first year of the program. I was the only one who didn't because I was under the impression it was full blown teaching when most TAed for a lab course in reality.

Fast forward to later in my PhD program and my first PhD advisor drops me due to how I managed the lab as well as the thought I could do a PhD but it wasn't my time. We also had a misunderstanding, but I won't elaborate since this post will be long as is now. She also noted that I could do things but that I ""stretch myself"" to reach the same point as others and that ""how I was born"" (she knew my conditions) contributed to what she saw with the lab management. I managed to get an adjunct role after my stipend got cut in half due to budget issues my 3rd year (same tuition waiver that paid off my program thankfully) and a visiting full time instructor role my 4th year when I was newly ABD and collecting dissertation data. I bomb both hard and had ratings that were usually 2s out of 5 before being pulled down to 1s out of 5 on most categories my last semester (I was also partially hospitalized too). Even though I switched to my current advisor in my 3rd year and am graduating this August... I have no publications and I'll be underskilled and overqualified at the same time.

So, to all those colleges who decided to admit me, why if this was going to go poorly? I knew someone in their first year when I was a second year at my Master's program who has similar diagnoses and accommodations as me (he got 2x extended time though) and took 3.25 years to graduate after his Master's advisor dropped him.

My country of origin is the United States and I live incredibly close to the border. All the schools that accepted me in the US, yes even public schools (my state is generally more expensive overall), were more expensive than going to school in Canada.

For a decent amount of time, I was on disability medicaid through our state‚Äôs program, but it has long since expired and has been a pain to reinstate due to the fact that I needed a part time job to help my family pay off our regular expenses and also just because of how convoluted every governmentally run program is to apply for.

My situation now: I am in need of about $25,000 USD for school this upcoming year. I was able to receive a small amount of an unsubsidized loan already from FAFSA, but they aren‚Äôt offering me more and determine my SAI to be high due to the fact that within the past few (less than 5) years my parents have gotten better paying jobs. It feels so unfair that they only judge your need based on income and not income-to-debt, or recognize that ALMOST ALL OF OUR MONEY IS GOING TO PAY OFF OLD MEDICAL BILLS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CHARGES $75 FOR A BAND-AID!!! There is no additional student aid program for disabled students!

Our credit scores are all terrible because of how many times we‚Äôve had to take out loans and put medical bills on credit cards after my dad‚Äôs major procedures and even our regular copays and medication costs. I‚Äôve been approved for a Sallie Mae loan last year, but now I am not getting approved for one this year. My school doesn‚Äôt accept many other types of student/education specific program funding directly (due to the international aspect?), and at this point I don‚Äôt care if I need to take out a personal loan with a terrible interest rate and transfer that money to my student account- I just need to finish my program.

So basically, I am in desperate need of advice and recommendations of where else to go for getting loans or if anybody knows of any scholarship opportunities for disabled students, or hell even if there‚Äôs a way to eliminate our medical debt through some forgiveness program as that would get rid of my family‚Äôs main issue entirely. We are just completely stuck and I really don‚Äôt want to quit on my education especially when I‚Äôve gotten this far and already accrued education debt from what I‚Äôve already started.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lvnf15/financial_aid_advice_for_a_disabled_student_with/","1752078923.0","college","OkRecover5897"

"i feel like a failure and don‚Äôt deserve the program i‚Äôm in","Just a rant because I feel lost and overwhelmed. Yesterday I enrolled to one of the best universities in my country as a freshman and got the first day because I was one of the top scorers. I was a STEM student who applied to an english language studies program because I‚Äôve always loved writing. There were so many people vying for slots that I ended up waiting for four hours just to finally go and sit where I‚Äôll be interviewed. 

The dean of the program interviewed me and I just completely sucked. I‚Äôve always had trouble communicating and bad anxiety problems but I didn‚Äôt think it would come biting me back at such a crucial time. I completely blanked out and couldn‚Äôt answer a basic question, something related to the eight parts of a speech and I couldn‚Äôt answer at all, only half. Which I remembered right after the interview. It was so bad I forgot about what even happened. Although I still got accepted in the program somehow, I still can‚Äôt forget how the dean told me how she could even accept me in when I couldn‚Äôt answer such a basic question. 

Her assistant (the one who actually was assigned to do the interviews) took over, and he spoke to me about how impressive and high my grades were but how he valued performance over numbers. And that since I was the first applicant he wanted to accept me despite my situation and that because there were many programs but I still chose them, he was willing to give me a slot but that he would remember me. I can‚Äôt help but feel I barely got in and ONLY got in because I was pitied. That I truly don‚Äôt deserve a place there. I feel humiliated by how I let my anxiety get the best of me at such an important moment and embarrassed that it was the first impression of me that the most important people of my program got. I don‚Äôt know if I actually deserve to go here and feel like I‚Äôll never catch up with my future classmates. I don‚Äôt know how to cope with my self doubts anymore because of how anxious I am all the time.

"Feeling frustrated with my experience so far","I've been taking classes entirely online at a community college because I don't have a way to get to class and I can't afford university right now... It's been pretty bad to say the least. I'm taking summer classes right now, and this is my first year. I haven't been on campus at all. I haven't made any friends or had any kind of fun experience because I just can't afford it. It's really disheartening seeing my friends post about their experiences at university and I'm still at home. All I do is do my assignments and then go to work. 

Moreover, some of this classes are just? Terrible? I've been taking classes nonstop, no breaks, and I am kind of reaching the end of my rope. Especially when I keep getting classes where the teacher doesn't even interact with the class at all or provide any instruction. Out of all the classes I've taken so far, I've had ONE teacher do recorded lectures. (And they don't even help. She posts several of them on Monday, all for one unit, then has an assignment due on Tuesday that tanks my overall grade at least 5 points if I score anything below an 80.)

I'm just tired. I'm tired of missing out. I'm tired of doing schoolwork. Tired of teaching myself everything. I wanted to get my associates and transfer to a university to save money but at this rate I don't even think I'll make it there. It doesn't feel like there's even a point to any of it at all. I didn't even want to go to college but it feels like if I ever want to make any kind of money that I have to. I used to be an incredible student in highschool but I just hate college. If I drop out now I'll never hear the end of it from my family... I don't think I will drop out but I can't get over the fact that the second I stop having assignments, my mental health immediately improves. I just had a week long break (for some reason my college gave us one but I'm not complaining) and the moment it ended, my mental health tanked. Throughout my life my mental health has always been really bad, with a lot of suicidal ideation and even attempts. But the moment I get a break from school, it just seems to melt away. I never wanted to go back to school. I just wanted to stop feeling so bad but it seems I don't have a choice. Just this first year alone I've had a few close calls. It's terrible.

"I‚Äôm a huge college hater despite being a good student.","I go to a U.S. college in the Midwest.

Anytime I talk to people they tell me I should just ‚Äúdo what makes me happy‚Äù but I really just want to get my bachelor‚Äôs over with. 

I‚Äôm taking summer classes rn and going into my 3rd year. I‚Äôm so insanely burnt out and I just can‚Äôt seem to stay on top of all my classes and responsibilities consistently. 

My perspective on college is super negative, and I tried my best to be delusional and romanticize it as much as possible but I just can‚Äôt.

This is my experience:
- Balancing a social life is insanely difficult (there‚Äôs nothing fun to do in a Midwest town, my friends are working or at different colleges/we drifted apart, making new friends is pointless because we‚Äôre not gonna be taking the same classes to really invest time in connecting)
- My family is constantly downplaying how hard it is and telling me to eat a snack, take a nap, or just being loud when I‚Äôm trying to study (no one has a degree/people dropped out or never tried- I‚Äôm trying not to follow)
- Professors are just on constant power trips that you have to kiss up to them. The phrase ‚Äúteachers make or break your grade‚Äù has never hit harder. I feel even worse when I get actual good professors but I fall behind because I‚Äôm catching up in the courses of the bad ones.
- Getting a good or bad grade doesn‚Äôt even register to me anymore. Good grade? Gee, on to the next. Bad grade? Damn, doesn‚Äôt even matter. 
- The scholarships I got barely cover anything, and all the $ I get from doing part-time jobs go right back into school. Debt is accumulating.
- College is essentially spending money to teach yourself, maneuvering professors, class projects, time-wasting assignments, and spending time in lecture halls trying not to lose your mind. 
- The material that‚Äôs relatively easy just end up being time-consuming for no reason, and the material that‚Äôs hard just burns me out cause I know it‚Äôll either be something I never use again or something I‚Äôll ‚Äúbarely‚Äù apply in the future. 
- Your worth being summed up in percentages, point systems, papers, exams, participation- actually insane. How bout I jump out this mf window and touch some grass!
- Gen-Ed‚Äôs and electives have got to be the dumbest money scams disguised as being a ‚Äúwell-rounded education.‚Äù
- College being the time to explore can be a lie when they ruin your favorite subjects and/or add up time to graduate.
- Oh you took this difficult class cause it was required? Never mind, it‚Äôs actually not required anymore so you wasted your time and it just counts as random credit hours now!
- Oh you thought these were the classes you were supposed to take and you planned out your four years already? Oops, we added a few more required classes cause we wanted to ‚Äúimprove the the curriculum,‚Äù have fun adding those in.
- Staring at a laptop for hours on end every day whether I move locations or not never gets better.
- My will to live is gone, my social life is barely hanging on, and the burnout will only get worse from here.
- My hobbies aren‚Äôt even enjoyable anymore because I‚Äôm thinking about all the things I have to do.
- I‚Äôve pretty much calculated every possible route I could take for my future and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm a failure and college just isn‚Äôt meant for me. 
- Time, energy, money, all getting depleted simultaneously for a piece of paper that shows people ‚Äúhey look I can do this‚Äù
- College is truly the boss that ends all if you can‚Äôt stay disciplined or romanticize it.
- I honestly feel better when people collectively say, ‚Äúcollege sucks and the system sucks but we‚Äôre here‚Äù instead of ‚Äúeverything in life is hard, choose your hard‚Äù like oh lawd ik gimme a break

"I feel like due to my college experience, if I don't have a job in my field, I don't have anything to show for the debt I have","I graduated from community college with a degree in Digital Filmmaking, hoping to get a career as a video editor. Apparently it's a hard field to break into and several years later (too embarrassed to say how many) I've only had 2 short term freelance video jobs while working a retail job.

That $230 I made from those jobs is definitely going towards my student loan payment, but I feel like to justify all the debt I got into to get the degree I need to be having a full time video editing job.

I've always had a hard time socializing with people. I don't know if I'm just shy or what, but it's been that way for a while. In high school I was voted ""most quiet"". I was hoping to change this when I went to college but I wasn't really able to. I tried sitting with people in the cafeteria and going to on campus clubs related to my interests but I still found it hard to talk to people, so much that at one club meeting some mentioned it (""This guy's said 3 words the whole time he's been here. Not even 3 sentences, 3 words!""). Everyone around me was making friends and dating and being in relationships, and I didn't do any of that. At my graduation ceremony, the only people there I knew were my family.

I didn't really make any friends or any memorable experiences in college. I feel like the only thing I got out of college was feeling lonely and depressed about it and also the degree, so if I don't have a full time job related to my major, then I'm basically $15,000 in debt with nothing to show for it other than a miserable lonely college experience. And apparently getting a video editing job requires networking, and I struggle with talking to people in general, let alone being able to network.

Since I only went to community college and one semester of a 4 year college before being academically dismissed for poor grades, the debt I have is less than if I got my bachelor's, and apparently degree doesn't matter in the video editing field, but if I'm going to be thousands of dollars in debt for several years, I want to feel like I actually got something tangible out of that experience to justify having the debt. It sucks to have all that debt and feel like you didn't really get anything out of it.

"My mom got a third job to pay for my sibling‚Äôs medical bills and I lost my Pell Grant","In 2024 my mom got a third job, and now I‚Äôm ineligible for the Pell Grant because my family‚Äôs income is too high. This is an issue because while my family is making more money, they also have more expenses. Their income doesn‚Äôt actually reflect how much we can afford. My sibling is sick right now and needs expensive treatment and most of it is not covered by insurance. My parents have accumulated A LOT of debt because my sibling has been receiving treatment on and off for about a decade. 

We are definitely going to write an appeal, and medical bills is listed as a valid reason. But we‚Äôre in a rough spot because my parents aren‚Äôt directly paying off medical bills. It‚Äôs technically debt, and debt isn‚Äôt a valid reason to appeal as far as I know. So there‚Äôs a huge change we‚Äôll get denied. 

So I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has gone through anything similar and had any luck with writing an appeal. Or if anyone has any advice or knowledge about what to mention or avoid. Any input would be appreciated!

"Should I finish college even if it‚Äôs expensive?","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a student at St. John‚Äôs University in Minnesota, studying International Business with a focus on Supply Chain Management. I'm going into my junior year and I have about 2.5 years left, and my total cost for tuition, fees, and housing for the entire program is around $90,000. Most of this is private student loans at roughly 9% interest; I only have a small portion in federal loans.

I currently have a paid internship working on multistate logistics projects, international and maritime supply chain issues, and compliance. The company has an open-door culture, and I‚Äôve gotten mentorship from division heads and even VP-level executives. I‚Äôm also working in alumni advancement at my school, which gives me access to a powerful alumni network‚Äîsome of whom are highly successful (one alum‚Äôs friend owns the largest yacht in Hong Kong harbor). The CEO of Best Buy also went to my school. There's also regularly top 500 companies that recruit directly out of school and scoop up new grads. Not to mention that this community feels like home for the first time in my life, and I don‚Äôt want to lose these connections or the support I get here. I grew up in an abusive home ripe with alcoholism and narcissistic abuse. This lead to me having life long issues of low self worth, picking poor friends, And a myriad of mental illnesses such as anxiety, major depression, and bipolar 2. This is truly the first place in my life where I feel safe within myself and like I can let my guard down. I've met friends who have saved my life and helped me grow into the healthiest person I've ever been, and I can't understate the value or the joy that they have brought to my life. And I don't want to lose that. Everyone on campus treats me incredibly kindly, from other students, to staff, and to the classes themselves. I truly feel like I'm finally allowed to grow into myself here and that I'm finally able to build the life I want for myself

Here‚Äôs my financial and career plan that I wrote up to give myself some sort of structure

Graduate with the degree in 2.5 years and immediately refinance my private loans to bring the interest rate down from 9% to somewhere around 5‚Äì6%.

Live at home after graduation to minimize living expenses, freeing up $2,500 to $3,000 per month to aggressively pay down loans.

Aim to pay off the entire $90k debt in about 3 to 4 years by making consistent, high monthly payments.

Earn professional certifications like CPSM or CSCP before graduating to increase my salary potential and marketability in supply chain roles.

Leverage the internship and alumni network to secure a strong full-time role that pays between $65,000 and $80,000 out of college, with the potential to rise to $120,000‚Äì$150,000 mid-career.

Use detailed KPIs and quantifiable impacts from my internship projects (cost savings, vendor compliance improvements, logistics optimizations) to build a strong resume and interview narrative.

I‚Äôm painfully aware this plan demands sacrificing a typical social life, dating, and many young adult experiences for the next several years. It feels overwhelming and, at times, like I‚Äôm choosing between my mental well-being and financial survival. I‚Äôve even had dark thoughts about the situation.

That said, I truly believe the debt and sacrifices are worth it if I can follow through on this plan. The network, mentorship, career potential, and stability I‚Äôve found here seem like rare advantages that don‚Äôt come with many other schools or programs.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I have a few points I'd like some help with.

I want to know if anyone else has dealt with $90k+ private loans while still in school and managed to pay it off aggressively post-grad. How did you structure your life and budget?

How did you balance intense debt repayment with maintaining any kind of social life or mental health?

Is the supply chain degree from a private university with a strong internship pipeline really worth the financial burden in the long term?

Any advice on navigating the alumni network and converting internships to strong full-time offers?

From what I read in the bill, I will need to be in 15 credits instead of 12 to be considered a full time student. The pell grant is being reduced & subsidized loan options are being eliminated. That leaves me in a tight spot since that aid is what makes it possible for me to attend college. I will probably need to see if I can qualify for some extra need-based aid from my uni & I will need to save up starting now.


Please tell me if I am panicking & overreacting? Can you please give me any other advice, if possible? Thank you for reading my post.

Edit: Turns out I was wrong about the BBB potentially affecting me in these ways. I heard the grad school student aid part is real, which is a shame.

"I'm losing hope because of Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill""","I just turned 20 in may. The same month I moved to Texas from Alabama because I was kicked out and living in my car. I came here to Texas to live with my ex-stepfather but it will not work long term whatsoever. I haven't gotten a job yet, I'm constantly rejected from the most menial of positions.

I'm still constantly applying, and if it comes to it I'll just work for the minimum wage, but here is my issue.

My reason for coming here at all was to try and get into a University here and either enter a study abroad program, or outright attend a foreign university.

I got myself into a community college, and my gpa is a 3.6 so far after two semesters.

But now, with Trump's Bill, I do not think I can afford any University here in Texas. I rely on snap benefits, and I'm facing homelessness. My dream of going overseas is becoming less of a dream and more of a desperate escape plan. But the goal was always to use my community college gpa to get into a University here, and then use my gpa there to get into a University overseas.

I have no set choice, I've been casually researching Germany only because I am most familiar with it.

But Germany doesn't acknowledge community college credits(I don't know if they'd care about my gpa either) and I doubt many other countries do.

My high school gpa is a 2.1 because my mother forced me out of school constantly because of her own beliefs and so I barely graduated. I thought I'd finally gotten past this, I knew it wouldn't be easy, but now it seems impossible.

If I can't afford university here, or snap is taken away, or I'm homeless again and the shelters lose funding. All I can think of is to drop out of community college and go to trade school.

But I don't want to live like this, I was kicked out because I want to pursue forensic science, and I stood my ground to achieve this. It feels like everything is working against me.

I am genuinely so lost. I'm trying to have a better future for my sister, to pave the way so she has a easy road to follow. But i'm caught in thorns and I feel like all she'll find is my corpse. How is she going to succeed if I can't?

I started learning German because its the least I can do, but I'll make it clear I am not set on Germany. The UK, Netherlands, etc seem fine to me. I'm sure the international aspects are better for other subs but I'm asking what am I meant to do now?

Is community college worth it anymore? Should I even try to go to a university here or should I take off for another country and then work my way up to an education there?

I feel like I'm running out of time, that if I don't do something I'm going to be poor and miserable just like everyone else in my family.

Originally I was going to have a 3 month stay in different European countries next year as soon as my passport is prepared, to see if I even like that environment/the culture, but now I don't know if I can even afford that or if I should just be jumping head first.

I feel like I've been born too late, I didn't have enough time to prove myself valuable with school so no country would see me as a priority. I know I am far from the only one attempting to leave the US. I hoped I could attend a school here long enough to make myself just valuable enough, but now I just don't think its possible when I only have so much in savings.

If I could get organized enough to figure out what I'm meant to be doing then I can do more research on my own, but now I'm overwhelmed and lost.

  
Edit: I am not expecting miracles! I will work as hard as I have to, and I know that Europe isn't a magical land of success. I want to get out of poverty no matter where I am, and now it seems that an education here won't do it unless I follow the same path my father and his father did, which didn't work.

Please give me the benefit of the doubt. I am young and na√Øve about a lot of things, but I know running to another country won't magically fix all my problems at the very least. I just want to understand the correct and most logical steps to take while working for this.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1lrqif4/im_losing_hope_because_of_trumps_big_beautiful/","1751655407.0","college","vomitonvelvet"

"Appealing - school denied my final semester","Hi everyone  
  
I‚Äôm writing this post because I recently received news that my school won‚Äôt let me proceed to my final semester, and I‚Äôm at a total loss. I‚Äôm appealing the decision but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll work, and I‚Äôd really appreciate advice or support.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

* I had to undergo two major surgeries for medical reasons at the start of my 6th semester (7 semesters in total).
* I‚Äôve been living alone since both of my parents passed away in 2023. When I began school in 2022, they were alive and I lived with them, so I had financial stability (I was 24 at the time).
* After their death, I‚Äôve been managing everything alone: paying rent, working 80% (4 days/week) just to survive while doing 2.5 days of school and studying weekends for almost weekly exams, doing my assignments etc.
* I‚Äôm also undergoing HRT since 2022, which has been medically necessary for me.
* Despite being under extreme stress and depression, I still passed most subjects. I was only half a grade (!!!) short of making it through.
* I had repeated a year before due to the emotional toll (HRT and parents), but I bounced back.
* The school was cold and inflexible about my situation, even when my surgeon had to step in to confirm the surgeries‚Äô importance. They didn't want to let me get my surgeries basically and I had to fight for it.
* I feel this is deeply unfair since I‚Äôm six months away from graduating and I‚Äôve fought through things most people thankfully never have to.

I‚Äôm appealing the decision, attaching documentation like the surgery confirmation, death certificates (perhaps optional since they're confidential to me), employment records, mail exchanges with my doctors, and more.

Any advice on how to word this better, or similar experiences? Do you think I can receive empathy to my situation?

**TL;DR:**  
School denied my final semester. I lost both parents, live alone, work 80%, had surgeries, and fought through depression + financial hardship. Missed passing by half a grade. I‚Äôm appealing with full documentation.

"My parents are taking my degree choice way too personally and it's weird","Swear my mom takes my psychology degree as a direct insult to her life choices like every family gathering turns into backup plan resolutions. Like mother, this IS the plan and dad keeps sending me indeed links for real jobs and I'm just trying to survive organic chemistry over here.

"Should I drop out of university because of mental health? Advice needed.","Hi, Sorry if this is long! I‚Äôd greatly appreciate if you took the tiime to read it.

I‚Äôm heading into my final year of uni after taking a mental health break, and I‚Äôm seriously considering dropping out.

I took a year off after a rough period‚Äîmy mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.

For context, i‚Äôve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I‚Äôve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.

Since January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven‚Äôt been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîmeds, structured routines, new environments‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt focus or motivate myself. It‚Äôs like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.

Now I‚Äôm questioning everything. I don‚Äôt enjoy my course and can‚Äôt picture myself in a 9‚Äì5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing‚Äîespecially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I‚Äôm terrified this would confirm it.

I want to get better, but I don‚Äôt know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.

"I dropped out of highschool and I need realistic advice","Sorry this is my first Reddit post so I'm not 100% sure how it works, I'm just going to start. I just turned 18 and dropped out of highschool because of social problems but I still can get my diploma from an exam that takes place multiple times a year, my goal is to take the earliest exam so I can move out and go to college as fast as possible, since where I plan on going it is technically possible to be starting in 2026.

I plan on going to a fashion school and I have autism and high intellectual potential (translated this so I'm not sure if it's the correct term but I essentially got a diagnosis when I was 11-12) and I generally get a grasp on things easily on my own, my main problem usually lies in self discipline.
 
I'm obviously biased because I want to get out as fast as I can but I wanted to know how fast I could learn 2 year's worth of content in an easier system, more time on my hands and no social conflicts.

My options for the exam are the CNED and the CESS TTR and I wanted to know how realistic the hope of going to college the next school year is.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1lwenih/i_dropped_out_of_highschool_and_i_need_realistic/","1752158950.0","highschool","WeightPlus6468"

"How I finally fixed my broken communication skills (with 5 books that saved me)","I used to feel like I completely lacked communication skills. Even a ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day‚Äù could shut down my brain. After getting laid off, I spiraled. Every interaction felt like a test I couldn‚Äôt pass. I‚Äôd nod and smile while silently screaming at myself to say something. At night, I replayed every awkward moment like a horror movie. I felt broken. So I got help. I worked with a social coach for a full year and what I learned changed everything. If you‚Äôve ever felt like your mind just blanks, this post is for you.

The biggest thing my coach said was this: you‚Äôre not boring, you‚Äôre buffering. The thoughts are there. Anxiety just blocks them from surfacing. Once I stopped trying to be interesting and started learning how to organize my thoughts, everything shifted.

Here‚Äôs what actually helped:

‚Ä¢ Anxiety steals your working memory which makes retrieval hard in real time

‚Ä¢ Good conversation is about recognizing patterns not inventing new thoughts

‚Ä¢ The more present you are the more your energy leads the flow

These 5 books helped me rebuild my social confidence from scratch

[Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king) by Patrick King: Patrick breaks down conversations into simple and repeatable stages. This book helped me stop overthinking and start flowing. After reading it I stopped panicking about what to say next and focused more on just being there.

[Smart Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/smart-talk-by-lisa-b-marshall) by Lisa B Marshall: This book gave me the actual phrasing structures to sound smoother without memorizing scripts. Reading it on BeFreed made it even easier to digest and apply. I finally felt like I had a roadmap in my head instead of noise.

[Just Listen](https://www.befreed.ai/book/just-listen-by-mark-goulston) by Mark Goulston: Mark is a renowned psychiatrist and coach featured in Forbes. This book taught me how to diffuse defensiveness and make people feel truly heard. The Persuasion Cycle section alone shifted my conversations from awkward to connected. First convo I applied it to? Game changer.¬†

[How to Talk to Anyone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35210.How_to_Talk_to_Anyone) by Leil Lowndes: This is a classic for a reason. It‚Äôs packed with 92 small but powerful tools that actually work in real conversations. It gave me go-to ways to start, maintain, and deepen connections. After reading it, small talk started to feel a lot more genuine and less forced.¬†

[Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22836493-influence) by Robert Cialdini: One of the most famous psychology books ever written. It changed how I think about connection and persuasion. Helped me build rapport and read social cues without second guessing myself all the time.¬†

If your brain ever goes blank mid conversation you‚Äôre not alone and you‚Äôre not broken. Read ten minutes a day. Practice just one tool at a time. The more you show up the easier it gets.

"I want to officially end this debate now. Did my mindset *really* hold me back from achieving more? Or did I not acknowledge my limitations enough early on? (long post)","I've (31M) had this debate over two accounts (including this one) and I intend to end it now. I get the critique from others in real life and online that I don't take enough initiative. I don't think that's true at all because no one sees the part of me that comes home from work exhausted at all. I think it's just a natural response to me doing something where I overexerted myself. I did post on an alternate account in various college subreddits about why colleges would even admit me in the first place (undergrad) and then again (Master's) and again (PhD) until things ultimately became worse on myself. Someone did say their sister got a 2.3 GPA from a top 5 engineering school. But yeah, it was a top 5 school, of course it was hard. I went to a stoner school because of the good scholarships and got thrashed anyway.

Anyway, here's my whole background:

I'm about to graduate with my PhD in Experimental Psychology on August 7th. I know this is ironic, but Experimental Psychologists focus solely on research and don't treat patients with therapy or anything like that at all. Unfortunately, I don't have any publications either.

As for my conditions, my neurodivergent conditions are ASD level 1 (Asperger's as a kid, hence why I'm posting here), ADHD-I, motor dysgraphia, and 3rd percentile processing speed. My mental health conditions are generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder - moderate - recurrent, and PTSD (from how my first advisor in my PhD program treated me actually). I didn't do well in undergrad (3.25 overall GPA, 3.52 major GPA) or in my Master's (3.48 GPA). I did fine in my PhD (3.92 GPA not that it matters at that level anyway as long as you're not on academic probation), but I only got through my Master's and PhD programs by working with my cohort a lot as well as using notes during what should've been closed note closed book exams for two difficult classes during COVID. There was no Lockdown Browser to keep up accountability so everyone did what I did. Not saying it's right but just putting that out there. I wasn't a good student in my classes nor did I ever work on multiple projects at a time. I also had a coach work with me all throughout undergrad and a different help me with graduate school admissions and who I still occasionally see now.

What got me to post here was asking on the professors subreddit via this account about how I can succeed going back into adjuncting an online course after flopping the last time I taught as a full time visiting instructor. I mentioned the details in the previous paragraph about my difficulties managing the workload and the unanimous response from all of them was that teaching wasn't for me at all, before throwing my main concern back in my face about someone now in their 30s who is overeducated and underskilled too. That's not mentioning that my current summer internship (which is my second time doing this after I worked last summer as well) didn't go well for me last year at all and now I'm back managing multiple projects (3 at least) and I'm having a hard time keeping up. I'm only getting grace now I imagine since I started two weeks late after an unexpected visit to the emergency room for what I later learned was a 6.5 cm benign cyst on my liver that flares up when I eat too much. The hospital I'm interning at also primarily runs on NIH funding. So, even though my boss has said that he'd try and find a way for us to continue our work with him if we're interested (I expressed interest so he said he'd get back to me when he has the chance), I don't know my odds given what's happening with NIH funding right now.

Up until this point, there hasn't been any good suggestions for what I could do at all to try and resolve my situation. I'll admit I'm still coping with the reality that I've wasted a decade plus of my life pursuing and having me and my parents funnel a ton of money into what was ultimately a fruitless endeavor for me. As for other jobs, I've worked retail stocking in the past, but my performance reviews stated I never met expectations at all, which meant that I'd be fired by my next performance review if I didn't meet expectations. Another retail place I worked was a super small underpaid Christian outlet store that didn't exactly do those at all, but they wanted me to pick up the pace and voiced similar complaints before I left them once I got an adjunct position that I also left once I got the visiting full time instructor position.

I've voiced going on disability while working part time (or whatever number of hours someone can legally work here in the US before they get taken off of them) before, which was shot down because I've had a work history and a PhD under my belt even though I did the bare minimum. I also voiced in academic subreddits about doing a clinical research coordinator position since its a BA/BS level position, but that was also shot down because those positions involve managing multiple projects, which I'm bad at doing in my case. I even asked the occupational therapy subreddit and an autistic occupational therapist who thought that, up until this point, I didn't reasonably acknowledge the limitations my disabilities present and what would be a solid fit for me (he also thought I wasn't suited for the roles I'm applying to as well).

Overall, this is an extremely unusual position to be in. Despite me also asking for advice in academic subreddits in the past about this, I'm seemingly the only person they've encountered who is an overqualified and underskilled PhD at the same time. So, did my mindset *really* hold me back from achieving more?

"To instructors: what to do about an indifferent professor?","This wasn't allowed to be posted on r/AskProfessors so naturally I found my way to this subreddit.

If anyone here is inclined to respond with ""there's no such thing as bad professors"", I suggest ignoring my post and moving on. This will be long, so read the TL;DR. 

As the title says, I'm a student who's been serious about my education for my entire life. I try my best, and I approach challenging subjects with tenacity and rigor. I have an A in this class, but I'm close to giving up and just focusing on passing with the bare minimum. 

I've only left one public review on Rate My Professor, entirely positive, for my former physics professor because she deserved it. I don't go out of my way to do stuff like this unless a person is remarkable enough in what they do. My physics professor was excellent. Otherwise, I'm usually neutral or have mutual respect for my professors who seem like they care and try their best. 

The professor I have this semester is late to every lecture, does not teach but reads densely-worded slides for a STEM subject, uses content riddled with mistakes and hair-ripping inconsistencies and material not covered in the lecture, an online ""learning"" system with its own rules and an average of 3 hours to complete.  I understand people have bad days and make mistakes. Some of the best professors I've had made mistakes occasionally. I also understand having rough days. 

As an undergrad, I've went out of my way outside of class to clarify this subject to confused peers when their questions went unanswered or were answered poorly. All of their questions were reasonable and about the material. I took it upon myself to answer those questions outside the class and suggest better material to the students because I saw the light leave their eyes when they became more confused as this professor gave vague, circulatory, passive-aggressive answers. I'm interested in this subject outside of school, and I know a little bit about it to know what's right and wrong. I'm talking about a professor here who cannot answer the most basic questions about a subject matter. It's concerning.

I expect that professors should not only be experts in their subjects, but also know how to teach it in the best possible way to clear fogs in learning rather than make them notoriously more difficult to traverse. I expect professors to want to teach with the intention of wanting students to find joy in learning and make process as smooth as possible, especially when the subject matter is known to be difficult. 

I have to quality control the material at every turn and remind them to post agreed-upon assignments in the online learning system because they forget every single time. I'm done with the passive aggressive remarks when we ask legitimate questions about assignment set-ups and whether the agreed-upon material is available. It's disheartening when a professor does not keep their word on basic things we explicitly agreed upon during the in-person lecture. I dread being there every time.

I'm tired of trying to be understanding. I don't understand. I'm going to provide feedback during the end-of-course evaluations, which are private. I also want to warn future students who care as much as I do to avoid this professor and save their sanity. I'm close to posting a negative review publicly. I know that may not be as threatening as I think it sounds. Some of you may find it comical, *as if a scary* *Rate My Professor review has any impac*t. Fair enough. I know RMP is often filled with disgruntled students wanting to blow off some steam rather than an accurate reflection of professors' abilities. However, I feel like I have a duty to warn students like me, who like learning but don't like putting up with a professor who is clearly indifferent and chooses not to make the learning process easier by keeping their word about assignments and doing the bare minimum. I feel like we are test subjects, bearing of the brunt of mistakes and carelessness and inexperience. It has serious impacts on students who are trying their best.

I just want this professor to do better. I know they can. They've had a couple of great lectures in the sea of confusion and inconsistency. Should I go to office hours and express this to my professor in-person? 

TL;DR: Indifferent professor consistently making mistakes and not keeping their word. What can I do about it? How can I get them to improve so students of future semesters don't struggle needlessly? Key word being ""needlessly.""","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1ls07lc/to_instructors_what_to_do_about_an_indifferent/","1751685097.0","CollegeRant","Purple_Nesquik"
"Losing my home","TL;DR:  I am going homeless and I am possibly failing the year. 

Good day all. I am currently going to the Faculty of Humanities in a small uni town in Europe. It is close to my home, and I am usually scared of travel, so I opted to go there and see how things might go. My family raised me with the expectations of being a farmer or someone with a profession, so as a kid that meant that wine or olive oil production were a far higher priority than school, which did not translate well to my grades. I was never a great student, since I failed a class in elementary and always struggled in my education, but things did click during high school. I had high interest in languages, geography and while I wasn't brilliant in history, I did like it. After I graduated, I thus wanted to continue getting myself educated. I first wanted to apply for English and Italian, but my mother scared me away from the latter by claiming my Italian is inadequate, so I chose History instead. First year went quite well, I wasn't stalling with my studies and I made a good group of friends. However, the second year has been anything but pleasant. Trouble began very early In August last year, when my uncle died from cancer, followed by my grandma in September due to lung embolism and the suicide of my aunt in December. I made sure to attend my classes and I was willing to not let it get to me, although I definitely felt a significant burden from the grief I experienced, especially when my aunt died. However, January saw a significant downturn. Due to the death of my grandma, the inheritance of our house was split between my father and his brother (uncle). While at first we were discussing on renovation, uncle quickly began to speak to several people whom I am not familiar with about selling the house, and those talks reached a fever pitch in March when agents came to our house to inspect it and see how much it might be worth. My father tried to prevent him from going for this route, but apparently uncle is in severe debts after losing his job and spending his money on various drugs, and he needs this money bad. In April, the price was put up, and we already have a potential buyer. Because of the house being a 50/50 ordeal, this means that we will be getting a half of the cut. Unfortunately, that cut is likely not enough for us to afford an apartment, and we will soon completely lose our house. Uncle has been barging into our home each night, drunk out of his mind and taking things from our basement, and we have already had several fights over this matter. This has significantly affected my own motivation and mental health, and I have failed several of my exams, and I will likely have to repeat the year if I don't pass my retakes in September. I have spent sleepless nights thinking about the whole ordeal, I have cried myself to sleep multiple times, and I already had a night where I did nothing but drink booze to forget about what is happening in my family. All of us in the family are stressed, and we have had shouting matches almost daily because of the house ordeal, and I can't study properly even for my retakes. The subjects I have to pass are English Semantics (9/11), Syntax (9/10), English modern literature (9/17), European Medieval History (9/1) and Croatian medieval history (9/3). I am not sure if I am able to prepare adequately for all of the subjects, and I am honestly feeling trapped because of the situation at home. I wanted to take a pause, but I was so close to finishing classes that I wanted to persevere, yet now I feel like I should have just taken a gap year. I feel scared for the future of my family the most, because we are so close to losing our livelihood, and I feel betrayed by my uncle, whom I feel like I do not know anymore. I am trying to stay calm, but it is really, really hard. Please, any advice is welcome.

"My friends never last and I need help","Hi guys, I'm a rising junior in college and all I've seen that my friends have all fizzled out. I really don't understand what I'm doing wrong because I always reach out to people, and while I would have some response, it never sticks. For one reason or another, almost every friend I've met has either left or we have just fizzled out. Me and a friend decided to stop talking last year and because of this I distanced myself from our mutual friends (I realized after that most of my friends were her friends, but not my friends). I made some a new friend this semester, but no matter how much I reach out to her, she never responses. The same thing happened with my older friends.

I really want to leave college with atleast some solid friends (3-5?) that I can continue to talk with and I don't think that amount is large. I'd appreciate some help on what to do as I've already followed the typical advice-- joining new clubs, going to new places, inviting people I'm not close with to hang out. I

kinda hate myself for being like this and absolutely hate when I try over and over to reach out to people but no one replies :( This is me ranting, but I reached out to alumni and everyone raved about their friends and how their connections really stuck with them-- but I have no one that I'd even think of taking grad pics with.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lqootq/my_friends_never_last_and_i_need_help/","1751546788.0","CollegeRant","eithercryorpanic"

I have never gotten a grade this bad before, worse i‚Äôve done is C and i‚Äôm mad at myself that this happened. Im sad I have to retake the course (need c- for pre req) and waste more time redoing that on another course. I was going through a lot at the time so I failed the midterm. I thought I could make it up and I studied more and understood the material a lot more at the end but it wasn‚Äôt enough on final. I‚Äôm so mad I didn‚Äôt withdraw from the class, and now i‚Äôm sitting with a D+ on my transcript, and have to retake the class in fall because I need at least a C- as it is a pre requisite for a different class. On the bright side I got a A in different class so it might balance it out a bit, but i‚Äôm just so disappointed in myself and how I should have worked harder. I am bad at math and since i‚Äôve heard how hard stats was, I went in with the mindset I wasn‚Äôt gonna do well.

"I may have screwed up a major opportunity and I'm terrified (switching majors)","For context, I'm a 6th-semester Ivy student who was prior to yesterday double-majoring in neuroscience and English. Welp, I dropped my neuroscience concentration - sort of impulsively, but it may have been a long time coming - because I realized/admitted I didn't like it enough to tolerate a PhD/career in it. In studying neuro, I had intended to complete a PhD and attempt to break into pharma somewhere down the line. English, however - I couldn't be more obsessed with it (and have been since childhood), and (if all goes well) I'll be completing an undergraduate thesis and mayyybe a PhD in English (I genuinely really want to, but if it's either academia, the prospects for which are pretty abysmal right now, or being overqualified for jobs, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Still might do it, though lol). Thing is, I'll have accumulated about $130k worth of student loan debt upon graduating, and my parents cosigned my loans. I'm actually scared out of my wits that I'll be delinquent and they'll have to bear responsibility. Also, I'm not sure if I can re-add my neuroscience concentration at this point - I'm only halfway through its requirements either way - or if I even want to. Advice would be appreciated, although I guess I'm probably looking for reassurance at this point lol.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lou13w/i_may_have_screwed_up_a_major_opportunity_and_im/","1751349286.0","CollegeRant","xbabyace"

Right now I just want to rant and cry my heart out. I tried so hard in high school and even got into a uni which was literally the best choice for my major and it‚Äôs perfect for me in every way but because of the location I would have to pay over 40k a year just to attend which is so much more frustrating bc I was born and raised in that state. Alright fine well that dream is gone and my dad wanted me to stay close anyway so I decided to just go to an average state school but even when I felt like I was settling, they gave me a slap on the face with the 20k tuition which is insane for being in-state. I feel so guilty for my parents who agreed to help me pay even though they were struggling too especially with my dads unemployment but even more so depressed because it feels like all my efforts for the past years have been in vain. What‚Äôs even funnier is that my friends who barely tried in school are paying less than me just because they signed up for a program which I wasn‚Äôt aware of and could‚Äôve applied for, which would‚Äôve payed for 10k of my tuition. If their mom hadn‚Äôt forced them to apply the day of the deadline then they wouldn‚Äôt have known either. At this point what was the point of my hard workin high school?

My mental health went down the drain and I failed every class. I dropped out, but before I did, I was placed on Academic Probation which I reassumed when I enrolled again at the same college for the fall semester. I enrolled in a full course load containing four classes. My advisor is encouraging me to drop down to two classes so I can gradually work my way back in. Also, if I fail these four classes again, I will be placed on Academic Suspension and forced to sit out for a semester.

"Telling my AP that I want to change my major...","Previously a Architectural Engineering Major (I chose this major because my dad told me to pick a major that would pay me 65000+, and it was also what I was mildly interested in) going to a community college, I want to change to Psychology. I hated AE for 2 years (been going for 3) and am supposed to transfer to another college next semester. My parents also want me to apply for an intership this summer. Truth is, I loved Psychology (interest started in Middle School, peaked in Highschool) and want to get a connected degree (Human Services to Psychology). I also have ADHD, so it's harder to concentrate and complete assignments on time (sometimes I need reread a page dozens of times to understand it). I also noticed that I was so interested in it that I didn't burn out during the middle of the semester like I usually do and managed to hold until the last two weeks where I slowed down (still passed). 

My APs hate each other and only stay together for my younger brothers (youngest is 10). My AF is emotional distant with my mom (also his mother treated my mom badly and he did nothing). My AM hates that my father (who works 7 days a week 8-10 hours) doesn't do considerate things (washing dishes, loading dishwasher, etc.).

My AF is already mad that I'm taking longer than the ""needed"" years (taking 5 years instead of 4) to finish my study (they don't understand that credits are what counts the most). My AM mentioned a few times that once I graduate, to get an apartment and take her away from my AF. Though, she (probably calmed down after seeing the rent prices) hasn't mentioned it for months. 

For reference, my mental health got so bad last year (summer through fall semester), that I got suicidal to runaway to deciding to stay after speaking to a counselor (college provides mental health service). There's also finances to consider. My father constantly asked if I applied for a loan (which I have not done yet). I was planning to pay it through, semester tuition is 2000-2500 for full-time students. There is also the fact that they want me to take 4 classes a semester, something I now understand that I really can't manage, 3 is my max. But they refuse to learn about or see the symptoms of ADHD.

I know I can't delay this much longer and need to tell them. My original plan was to email or text them this information while I was at work or something. Since I've been keeping this to myself, my anxiety and stress level is through the roof.

"Please be blunt with me‚Äì do I have a shot at getting into a good graduate school program? (LONG post)","I'd ask r/college, but they delete everything when I talk about my mental health. Fair warning for mentions of suicide, drugs, and abuse. I won't be going into too much detail, because that's gruesome.

So, when I hit high school, my mom turned to drugs which made her violent and abusive (to the point I had to worry about my life). This screwed over my high school GPA, which was a 2.4 (weighted).

So I went to community college, broke and unprepared, because I needed to get out of that abusive household. But because I was so unprepared, I failed all of my classes my first semester. I was also hospitalized for mental health reasons that semester, which caused me to give up and fail.

I retook all of my classes next semester and ended up getting around a 3.2~ish? So, not bad. Nothing below a B-. I did finish this semester, but around April after my finals, I attempted suicide. I lived (duh), but I never told anyone until a year later and I never went to the hospital for it, so nobody knew. All of my credits taken so far have been for either my biology major or general education. Nothing related to my current major.

I continued through online college, and decided to transfer when I had around a 3.0. Really not great, but not that bad. I transferred to a university that wasn't my first choice, but it was better than nothing. I was an animation major (I had no clue what I was doing, and I really thought an animation degree from a mediocre Midwest university would get me somewhere), so a lot of my credits from here were related to animation.

That year (2023/2024) I got hospitalized twice (both times during finals) for mental health reasons. I got a 3.889, though!

I decided to come back home to online college to finish up my associate's degree I never finished. I retook a class I initially failed (it was during my previous online period) because it was just a hard ass class, but I retook it and got a C. Hardest class I've ever taken and it was a level 200 gen-ed run by a guy who was disappointed his life never went the direction he wanted it to go. Anyways. I also got a good grade in my other class and bumped my GPA up to a 3.208.

Got my associate's degree now, finished last December and decided to take the spring semester off to save money for another school I wanted to transfer to. During the summer and fall of that year, I was hospitalized twice. During the fall and the winter of that year, I ""attempted suicide"" twice (I wasn't faking, I just don't know what else to call it and I don't want to get into details). Making three attempts in total. I was diagnosed with bipolar II after my third attempt (I also got diagnosed with ADHD and C-PTSD previously, but these didn't affect me as much).

I talk about all of this even though it's really hard for me because I believe it's essential to my story and who I am. I don't know how much I can talk about on college applications, which absolutely sucks. If I go too into detail, I'm seen as a burden and asking for pity. But that's not what I'm doing and I know for a fact I'm not a burden.

Anyways, today I have a combined 3.495 GPA, and I'm transferring to a local university much closer to my dad, that way I have support if something bad happens. But, with medications and being properly diagnosed, my hopes are high. I'm currently going to aim for a 3.9/4.0 (although as long as I have a 3.2+, I'll be okay, as that's the requirement for completion of the honors program). And the reason I'm so positive I might be able to aim this high is because if I can get a 3.5 unmedicated (with bipolar disorder, I need to stress, because that is a BITCH to live with undiagnosed) and unsupported, I think I can get even higher with proper medication and proper support.

I'm now going into marketing (I'm positive I'll stay with my major this time, because I told myself if I don't like it that's too bad), and I'm actually really excited for my classes. So, my first goal is to get a 3.9/4.0 (although I won't beat myself up if I don't get this!), and graduate with a couple internships under my belt. Next, I plan on working for a couple of years (needed for an MBA) while studying for my GMAT (my ideal score is 700+, again, won't beat myself up if I don't get this), and after my MBA and a couple of years with that, I want to get my doctorate and eventually become a professor. I'd also ideally maybe work with nonprofits.

Anyways, now that that spiel is out of the way, let's say these for a couple of examples: I get my ideal GPA of a 3.9, and I get a 730 on my GMAT exam (because I am going to study like a sonofabitch for it), I got good essays (maybe related to my personal experience, maybe not), I explain in my application that I had medical issues preventing me from reaching my full potential. I am also a female coming from an impoverished area, with parents who are both disabled. I am also first-gen, female, and white. I got good extracurriculars under my belt (including working since I was 16), as well as a couple of years (lets say two as the minimum) of relevant work.

I'm fine with getting into a small, nameless school for my MBA (if I choose that as my master's instead of something else). But that's not what I want. I want something that'll impress people. If I get the statistics I previously mentioned, I'll be applying to M7s. I do not expect to get into these M7s, but I'll beat myself up if I don't apply. More realistically, I'll be applying to T25s, preferably the University of Michigan. I'm looking for a fully covered tuition, or at least, half covered.

Be honest and blunt with me, what do I say on my applications, and what are my chances?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1li37jg/please_be_blunt_with_me_do_i_have_a_shot_at/","1750639070.0","CollegeRant","None"
"College has been nothing but pain","First off, I want to say that I'm in community college, so maybe that's why I'm experiencing the issues I‚Äôm about to vent about in this post. I'm a second-year student and will soon transfer to a four-year university. My experience with college has been horrible, and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm the crazy one because no one else I talk to seems to be having the same experience.

Let‚Äôs start with the classes.

1. The professors suck. They don‚Äôt seem to care about us or the course itself. It feels like they just show up to collect a paycheck. Most of them teach by reading off crappy PowerPoints ‚Äî the kind they could‚Äôve just uploaded online ‚Äî but instead, they waste an hour reading them out loud and call it a day. Then they assign work that‚Äôs almost completely unrelated to the slides. I honestly wish I could get paid thousands of dollars just to read slides. Nice to know where my tuition money is going.


2. The students are assholes. I‚Äôve never met so many rude or fake people in one place. There are basically two types: people who don‚Äôt want anything to do with you, and people who just want to use you ‚Äî either for favors or something else. I‚Äôve yet to meet someone genuine. It‚Äôs also really hard to make new friends. The clubs at my school are worthless, and the people who do go to them are already in tight friend groups. I‚Äôve been to three different clubs ‚Äî big ones, like the gaming club and anime club ‚Äî and the average attendance is like four or five people. So I gave up. At this point, I‚Äôm more isolated than a prisoner.


3. College takes up so much time, and time is money  and I‚Äôm broke. To top it off, I‚Äôm not even sure I want to continue with my major. Thanks to some terrible teachers, I‚Äôve come to hate accounting, which is kind of ironic since it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm studying.



So to recap: the teaching sucks, the social life is nonexistent, and I‚Äôve grown to hate my major. Why am I even doing this?

I‚Äôm halfway through, so now I just feel obligated to keep going. I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, because everyone else ‚Äî even people at my school ‚Äî don‚Äôt seem to have these issues. I didn‚Äôt expect college to be perfect, but the fact that I can honestly say I had better education in high school is wild.


TL;DR: The education sucks, the social life really sucks, and college is making me more miserable than I‚Äôve ever been.

"My parents make $0 and seeing other student's parents paying $200k+ for their tuition makes me sad","My parents are both disabled‚Äì the only reason they have a place to live is because our grandma lets us live at her house for almost completely free. But even before they became disabled, my dad was a roofer and my mom was a factory worker, so they weren't making anything spectacular.

My mom did have a small savings before she became disabled ($10k), which was a LOT to us, but she ended up blowing it all on drugs. That's the ""richest"" we've ever been.

I make more than my parents at $14/hr as a food clerk at Meijer. I do have a savings of $8.5k, currently. I am also in a lot of medical debt due to lots of psychiatric hospitalizations (maybe 7 or 8?). I currently have a collection marked as a derogatory on my credit score because I couldn't even afford $10/mo at the time it was given to me. (I completely forgot about this debt, and I have received nothing in the mail about it being in collections... I plan on calling them to see if I can resolve this, but I doubt it).

I went to community college to save money, but it ended up kind of screwing me over, as every university in the state doesn't offer free tuition towards transfer students (except for the University of Michigan, which is not only on the other side of the state, but I got screwed over because the dad I DO NOT LIVE WITH and get NO assistance from technically has assets over $120k, even though he makes $50k/yr). Grand Valley State did offer free tuition for transfers until last year. All these cool programs about free community college were not there when I graduated in 2021.

I have $15k in student loans (I'm in year four of college). Not great, not horrible. I'm saving my money so I'll be able to pay it off.

I'm awaiting to see if I won an $11,000 transfer student scholarship at my university.

Even with the full Pell grant, the full amount of loans, FSEOG grant, and scholarships and grants from the university and from outside scholarships, I still have to pay $5,000 out of pocket (hence why I'm awaiting to see if I won this scholarship). Good news is I'll get tuition reimbursement from Meijer, so this should go back in my pocket.

I just saw a post on r/FAFSA about a student who was a full blown millionare talking about his FAFSA. He proceeded to go into the comments and make insulting comments about poor families, as if it's our choice to be poor. This really hurt.

It also reminds me of the multiple times fellow students will come up to me asking ""what do your parents do?"" and I have to tell them every time that they're disabled and make literally nothing. People act shocked (albeit all of them have been supportive), but it makes me feel so out of place.

And I'm going to be real for a second, I am 100% envious of students who can afford to go to ivy leagues out of pocket and live in luxury apartments because of their parent's pockets. And sometimes seeing these people pisses me off, even when it shouldn't. I know better than to be angry, because it's good to see that somebody is succeeding in the world and has supportive parents, but at the same time, I can't really help it.

But mostly it just makes me feel really sad. I wish I grew up with more money. I wish my mom wasn't a drug addict. I wish my parents weren't disabled (for both their sake and mine). I feel so out of place sometimes.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lgldgx/my_parents_make_0_and_seeing_other_students/","1750471562.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Living home with my toxic dad","Hello guys. I'm currently a sophomore doing my summer classes. I recently withdrew from an intro to Philosophy course. To get straight to the point, basically I was super overwhelmed from the online class and simply the online class just didn't feel right to me so guys I thought withdrawing the course was good to save my GPA and that's what I did. I withdrew from the course. Fast forward, when I had this conversation with my dad that I withdrew from this course, he literally cursed me out and called me an a-hole for not asking for help and like he was so unhappy and so frustrated. Like I want a nice GPA even if it comes at a hard choice of withdrawing an online summer course like that. Withdrawing courses is not easy but I had to do it to save my GPA. Sorry if I sound like a neurotic kid but my GPA is 3.47 right now cumulative. I'm a chemistry major. A couple of things I didn't find right was that online courses are generally not suitable to me and the pace felt a bit too quick. I'm more of a slow learner when it comes to philosophy. I was simply overwhelmed with work guys. 

He cursed me out and made me feel so bad about myself, like yes dad I'm trying hard but sometimes I'm too overwhelmed to ask for help. HE LITERALLY SAID I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH I'M (MOSTLY) GETTING As and Bs IN MY OTHER COURSES!!! I EVEN TOLD HIM THAT BUT HE DISMISSED MY EFFORTS. For context, he pays the tuition of my university so he kind of has a right to intervene and ask me. That also pushes me to the halfway point always, should I move out and actually live my life I want in a college out of town but have to deal with not-so-healthy college foods and have to eat out at Chipotle or something to satisfy my hunger. I don't know man, he has been like this since when I was a young kid. But no hate to my dad, I love my dad so much and I will continue to love him but at the same time, man you gotta acknowledge my efforts. Anyway guys, what can I do in this situation guys? I am typing this at night so I may not be able to reply to you instantly but I might reply in the morning. 

  
TL;DR: My dad called me an a-hole and cursed me out and didn't acknowledge my mental health at all, I even communicated my efforts and yeah sometimes I got overwhelmed. I even communicated my efforts but he dismissed those efforts and even threatened me that if I continue down this road, expect me to call you (aka me) an even worse curse word.

"I ruined my GPA in a span of six weeks","I can't believe it. I finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA. I was one of the few people whose marks actually went up from high school to uni. I decided to (stupidly) take two accelerated, online, six-week summer courses that spanned from early May to about now. I knew I was burnt out by the end of April, but the only reason I took those courses was to not be viewed as ""an unproductive loser"" (because I didn't apply to a summer job, and I was discouraged to as well, by my parents) by my household. I think I failed both courses.

I don't know what happened to me. I felt so unmotivated and procrastinated a lot during them. I don't know what I was thinking. I thought of doing a withdrawal from both but I didn't, because I thought I could push through. Now it's a stain on my transcript forever. I think I failed both. One of those courses is related to my major (economics), an intermediate level one, and now I'm discouraged that maybe I should switch majors. Despite me getting A's in the introductory courses and having a genuine passion for the subject. I'm devastated. I think this will only further my depression. I don't even know what I can blame; my laziness or depression. I may not even have depression; I may be unknowingly just using it as an excuse to mask my laziness. My parents are consoling me but I feel ashamed of myself. It's a nightmare.

I have no one to blame by the way. The professors were good, and the tests were fair. I only have myself to blame.

I knew I'd mess up at something. It seemed too good to be true that I had a 3.7 in my first year, given I've had one struggle after another since like 2022 (mainly personal/mental issues). I thought something was finally looking up for my life. But I was wrong. I'm back to square one. When I graudated high school last year and started university I had pledged to myself that I'd do well, and that university would be a ""fresh start"" after the worst 4 years of my life which was high school. Now I'm back to square one. Wow.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfqoyp/i_ruined_my_gpa_in_a_span_of_six_weeks/","1750379833.0","CollegeRant","ReactionWater7016"
"I was the crazy roommate back in 2023‚Äì it was horribly embarrassing and shameful","MASSIVE trigger warning for suicide.
I don't really know if this is a rant as much as it is ruminating about something terrible. I would talk about it on r/college, but that'd be a guaranteed post being taken down and/or ban. I guess I just need to open up about this.

So I was 20 and I lived with 18 years olds, we met on Facebook and decided to be roommates on-campus for 2023/2024. They seemed really cool.

We got along VERY well (in fact, my roommate had a crush on me, but of course I didn't initiate because I didn't want to date an 18 year old lmfao). We were very close friends.

Well, a couple months in, things started to sour a bit. One of our roommates was irritating everybody else. I had disagreements about how to do the chores (I don't even remember what it was about clearly), and I tried explaining this clearly quite a few times, they just never really got it (or they chose to ignore it).

They did quite a few things that pissed me off, and I do believe that they didn't like me because I disagreed with how to do chores and I was open about it. They were very messy roommates (got warned for their messiness right before I left, left shitty underwear on the counter, garbage everywhere, dirty dishes, used period pads in the shower...) and that irritated me. They expected me to pick up after them, basically.

They started being more and more cold to me as time went on. We started to dislike each other, two of my roommates started to gang up against me and my other roommate.

I'm very stressed out about my grades around this time, and I never told anybody, but I was deeply struggling with suicidal thoughts. When my roommates were gone, I would scream and curse to myself because of how stressed out I was (I was losing it, yes). My roommate did find a suicide note I left at one point, to which I just kind of... apologized to the best of my abilities, and I told her I was okay. She was actually pretty kind about it. She invited me to have tea and talk about fun stuff with her.

I was going crazy by this point. My thoughts made no sense and were very jumbled. I was barely stable in classes, but I did resemble a bit of sanity to the point people outside of my roommates thought I was normal.

I told my residence hall director what was going on. I was afraid to talk to my RA because I knew they'd want to have a group chat with my roommates, and I was afraid to confront them and be singled out even more. He just kind of sighed, made a little comment about not going to the RA, and he didn't really do much. He didn't take me seriously at all, obviously.

Time passes, and we eventually get into a big argument in the group chat. I don't remember about what other than chores and me feeling ganged up on. I was slamming doors and kicking stuff. Eventually, my roommate awkwardly comes into the bedroom and ignores me, and I guess I just kind of snapped. I muttered ""I can't do this anymore"" and grabbed all of my medication and went into the bathroom.

By this point, I took my phone and I called 988, because a small part of me recognized that I was not okay and I needed help. I ended up screaming and sobbing. I was minutes away from downing every pill I had and drinking a combination of all the chemicals I had around me. Fortunately, 988 called the police on me, and so did my roommates, because I think they suspected that something was deeply wrong. A roommate did knock on the door and ask if I was okay, to which I replied yes (I wasn't).

Of course, the police show up along with the person working at the front desk at the time, and I'm taken away to a cop car to the hospital where I was involuntarily admitted for about a week.

By this point, I thought I just had major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. I did have a suicide attempt about a year or two before this.

A week passes and I'm taken back to campus right as finals were about to happen. Great news, my residence hall director emailed me telling me there was an opening in the building, and there was another person seeking out a roommate because of their bad roommate situation. I did have to spend another night at my old dorm, and it was a little awkward, but it was calm. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about it.

Eventually, I did move out. It was awkward and silent between my roommates as I was packing up. My roommate did offer to help me pack very kindly. I refused the help, but I did thank her. And then I moved three floors down.

My new roommate was awesome. We did have a ""disagreement"" on how to do chores, in the sense that we had different ideas of what to do, but we came up with a scenario that worked for both of us very quickly and easily, they were very understanding and nice. We got along just fine for the rest of the year.

I did run into my roommates twice. One time, we ran into each other while I was leaving the dining hall. We smiled at each other and I opened the door for her, and she said thank you. Another time, my roommate left my stuff in a bag by my door that I forgot to pack with a note that said ""Have a great summer :)"", I emailed her thanking her and telling her to have a great summer back. And that was the last we heard from each other.

After this, I transferred back to my community college (partially out of embarrassment) and lived at home while I got my associate's degree (which I earned last December, and then I took the winter semester off). I attempted suicide two more times, and went to the hospital involuntarily three more times.

So, um... yeah, I was the crazy roommate. And I feel just horrible. I mean, really, really bad (as I should). I think I traumatized my freshman year roommates. I don't care how mean they were being towards me at the moment, what I did wasn't okay. But I didn't know what else to do. I was losing my mind.

And what breaks my heart even more is that they were so nice to me about it later. I did meet a friend of my roommate after that incident, and she told me that my roommate spoke about the incident and me poorly, but I really deserve that and I'm okay with that. I almost wish they weren't nice to me about it at all. I think they understood that I wasn't quite all there.

I think the only reason I wasn't academically dismissed is because I did tell my RHD I was struggling a couple of times, and my dad called the college and explained the situation/my mental health. I did have to talk to the student success center and keep visiting them. Trust me, I wouldn't have gone to college and gotten roommates if I knew my mental health was going to be that bad.

Later on (just about 6 months ago actually), I got diagnosed with bipolar II, not MDD. Which explains (but doesn't excuse) the crazy behavior. I'm finally properly medicated. I'm not even suicidal anymore, and I feel genuinely happy, even with the downsides in my life.

I'm returning to in-person college this fall. I am going to have my own personal bedroom, but three suitemates (couldn't afford a single bedroom), but please don't worry. If something bad happens, I only live 20 minutes away from my dad at this university and can stay with him, and I am much more prepared to tackle things this time due to being properly medicated.

So, um... yeah. I was the crazy roommate. And I hate it so much. I feel so guilty (like I should). I guess I just needed to talk about it and open up about it. I wish I could email my previous roommates and apologize, but I think it's better if I left it alone. Like I said, I guess I just need to open up about it. If you read this far, I appreciate it.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1lfjc5m/i_was_the_crazy_roommate_back_in_2023_it_was/","1750360389.0","CollegeRant","None"
"Halfway done with college since last month and it's been a total shitshow","My college experience has been ruined by my shitty immigrant parents and mental illnesses. I knew the steps I needed to change but I just spiraled due to being scared and depressed and I blame myself for it

Firstly, I hate my parents a lot. My neurodivergence was a huge issue, but they made everything worse. They're Indian immigrant parents too by the way. They ruined the first 20 years of my life. They literally abused me a lot as a kid both physically and emotionally for the dumbest shit ever too, they just put pressure and expectations on me, they literally control and shelter me even at 20 and treat me like a fucking child and restrict me from freedom a normal teenager gets in the USA, and I'm pretty sure they only had my little brother and I so we take care of them when they're old or to see us as an extension of themselves. 

They got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis sometime in second to fourth grade, but didn't tell me until 7th grade just because I was too young. Hiding a diagnosis is one thing, but they constantly made me feel like a failure for those stuff and abused me. They KNEW the fucking reasons why I struggled with academics and social situations, had odd specific interests, struggled with attention span and comprehension, why I had to take special ed, why I had to take ABA therapy, why a doctor forced me on a gluten and dairy free diet in third grade and forced me to take some meds, and still fucking treated me like a failure and a bad kid. And until 11th grade, they absolutely REFUSED to get me a psychiatrist or meds. They don't understand my ADHD, autism, anxiety, and depression at all and sometimes even downplay my struggles. 

Like they're overall shitty parents. They force me to adhere to Indian culture when I don't connect with it at all and also force Hinduism and some ridiculous superstitions on me when I am personally not religious and they believe you should blindly follow these stuff no matter what and take them very seriously. 

Both of them are narcissists, but my mom even more so because she has almost every textbook trait of a narcissist, so she is generally worse. 

I hate how they say they ""give us everything we want"" and even say they're more lenient than other parents when all they did was give a few toys and stuff for gaming we want and pay for college and expenses which is the fucking bare minimum. They even brag about the BARE bare minimum like giving birth, raising us, wiping our asses, food, clothes etc. 

They say we're the ones who are seeing them as villains and not communicating our feelings and assuming they'll say no, but it's straight bullshit. 

They don't give a shit about anything I like. In elementary school, I loved lego sets and after 5th grade, they stopped buying them just because that was the only thing I bought and they thought I was too old. Even for my 11th birthday with my OWN allowance and birthday money when I wanted to buy a $120 lego set, they didn't let me for that stupid reason. In high school, I was passionate about gaming and even wanted to go pro or make content, but even on summer break, they only let me play 1.5 hours on weekends. And even now in college they're controlling. Like last year when I picked apartment housing for sophomore year, they fucking made me screen share and made me put reqs as no beef, no drinking, no smoking. Im still forced to follow religion and culture blindly, they force me to go on vacations with them or dumb gatherings with family friends. Like I'm 20 for fucks sake and still treated like 12. 

They have high expectations and think anything below a 3.5 is a bad GPA and they say we're lucky they don't expect 4.0. 

They just use the ""give everything you want"" and ""we pay for college and everything"" lines as leverage to control us and later use it in the future. They literally made us study in breaks and only care about us being successful.

Secondly, I hate myself for having ADHD, Autism, Anxiety, and Depression. ADHD and Autism fucking ruined my life since childhood. Like I said, it made me struggle academically and socially, made me mentally immature and behind, and have weird interests.Those weird interests made it hard for me to connect with people my age that since middle school, I withdrew myself completely because people became more judgy. While they were into normal interests like sports, pop culture, and TV shows better for their age group, I was still into shows considered childish and toys and even that way in high school. 

My anxiety and depression started in 6th grade too. I was even delusional until 12th grade just every day wishing for some magic powers, which is stupid I know, but it happened and one of the reasons I ruined my life. I did read that child abuse affects amygdala and hippocampus, which increases risk of anxiety and depression, which is probably why I have those two. 

Because of my parents and mental illnesses, I literally missed out on 20 years of my life and experiences like friends, partying, sports, dating, sex, being popular, having a fake ID etc.. Combine that with my parents pressuring me to get out of comfort zone and shell all the,  making friendships and socializing feel draining, and not assimilating to US culture and teaching us how to be socially successful just made me avoid everything. 

It also doesn't help that everyone these days also says that being shy, having no friends, and not fitting in is okay when that's the reason why most of my generation sucks. 

Fast forward to now where I halfway finished college a month ago and it's been an absolute shitshow. I'm at ASU and ever since I stepped foot in it on day 1, my life became much worse. I was placed with outgoing roommates who love to party. That was when I hated myself for how I was and wanting to be introverted when I kept hiding. Like I remember even one hot girl liked me and I didn't believe it. 

After that semester, I wanted to party but I realized you have to be in a frat to party. I wasn't confident enough to rush and then missed out and said I would do it the first sem of sophomore year. Just being lonely and dwelling on the past so much made me more miserable and spiral more that my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 3.59 and just rot more. 

But I did NOTHING to improve myself and just waited and then it came and I got no bids from the houses I rushed. You'd think I'd improve myself this time, but I fell in a worse spiral and tanked my GPA  to a 3.46 instead, even skipped classes for a whole month, and even had a shitty diet and worked out less. Then 4th sem came and this time same shit. It sucked because I actually tried this time and was more social and cracked jokes and everyone was gassing me up and even in one of the other frats I knew 4 guys from freshman year and 3 of them had exec positions and even acknowledged my change, yet I didn't get in a SINGLE invite only event. It sucks because sophomore year is generally the last time to rush. I know I could've gotten in a bottom house and still can in junior year because they bid anyone, but I hate them because they're like 40 members at most and all rejects who only joined because they were rejected from actual frats just for the sake of being in one, but they're still irrelevant. 

I know most people go to bars instead of frat parties and frat parties are usually off campus, but I really wanted this shit since second semester of college to meet a lot of people quickly and be popular and that's what I based my whole identity on to get in those specific frats. Even though people still tell me I can make a few drinking buddies and a girl and even if people drift after college, it sucks ass at the moment not being in a frat, especially under 21. 

I literally vowed that if i get a bid, I'd start getting my shit together.And it does seem like many people who party are in the frats I just hated everyone in greek life since then and hated people in general. The decent frats are mostly people who have been ready since HIGH SCHOOL. Many of them are even PROUD of being exclusive, but I bet a lot of them never had to deal with neurodivergence or a shitty upbringing. It sucked how they straight up gassed me up and cut me early. I'd rather have been straight up INSULTED and beaten up and thrown out rather than whatever the fuck that was. I hope a day comes where I get to beat these people up because after this rejection from the frats when it was my last chance to rush, I don't have a chance at the most optimal college experience possible.

I don't wanna join a club or just talk to people in classes because clubs are for nerds and nothing like frats. And I DO wanna party which most of these losers online are against. That semester was the worst that I even failed a class and tanked to a 3.29. I hate being told to just make the best out of everything. I was too scared coming from abuse and being sheltered and neurodivergence into college and anxious to talk to people because they wouldn't like me. This frat shit was the only shit I wanted in college and I have no chance anymore. 

My life gets worse every year, but ever since I started college, it's been much worse. I just hate myself for my fucked up mind making me miss out on everything. 

I don't know if I'll ever have a college experience as I hoped. I fucking hate this place and can't wait to graduate. I'm just so bitter and resentful towards the people having what I have and towards the people who excluded me. I hate my parents for not knowing how to be good parents and not assimilating to US culture and learning how to be cool. I hate myself for constantly spiraling and blowing up the last chance at rush. Sure I can get some drinking buddies and a girl and most people go to bars when older, but it won't feel the same as being in a frat.

"I shouldve never listened to my sister and now idk how to twll her about my choice for community college","Hi. I am a recently graduated high school student who was persuaded into applying to UC Merced instead of going to CSU Chico. I was dead set on going to Chico and even excited to see a brand new part of California even if it meant leaving my family far away. My sister pushed me to the only UC I got accepted to because ‚ÄúUCs have better education compared to CSUs‚Äù So I withdrew from Chico and thought I wanted to go to Merced even though they didn‚Äôt have the major of my choice (rlly dumb ik) sooo I was like ‚ÄúI GUESS ill go because UCs are better and I‚Äôll become a pharmacist instead of registered dietitian‚Äù So I attended Bobcat Day and explored UC Merced. Although the campus is nice, it was in the middle of no where and js not rlly catching my eye. But I still forced myself to like it because my sister arranged this JUST for me and spent a good amount of money along with my dad. After some heavy consideration, I didn‚Äôt want to be away from my mom. I know it‚Äôs nice to give yourself some experience away from home but I realized I am too young/I have no experience. And my mom is moving to houston at the end of the year so I was like ‚ÄúI rlly hate UC Merced, I‚Äôll just go to community college js so I would be close to home, save money and get into a school I actually want to go to.‚Äù Altho many people dunk on CC, I think it‚Äôs a great pathway for those unsure of what they want to do with their lives. I would rather go to a CC and not know what I want than go to a university and force myself to do a major that isn‚Äôt what I want. However I have yet to tell my sister. She helped me get house (for free) and helped me through all the admissions. I just know she is going to be pissed off once she learns that I don‚Äôt wanna go to university for the full 4 years. And I want to go to CC. She looks heavily down on CC (even tho she went to one and transfered to UCSB) and told me to at least go to UC Merced for one year even though I told her that is not what I want. I feel extremely controlled by my sister and it‚Äôs giving me stress thinking about how angry she will learn that I want to be near my mom. I shouldve js picked a community college from the beginning instead of a university i dont even like.
And even though financial aid covered for a lot of my stuff, I still have no interest in UC Merced. 
I rlly wanna go to Purdue, UCSB, University of Maryland, GWU, UCSD, Texas A&M or even UCLA if the chance comes around!

(Im sorry if this is missing details or more context is needed, I can give more in the comments)

What I am asking is how should I approach her about it and what if she tries to convince me to go to a University I didn‚Äôt like just because she never was able to do the full 4 years?

"If I medically withdrew from college, how likely am I to be accepted at a new one?","
Hello everyone,

I graduated high school in 2017. My parents told me at the time that they would help pay for college *if* I chose a Christian college. I ended up choosing Colorado Christian University and was accepted. I started in their 2017 fall semester. 

For reasons that would take far too much time to explain (suppressed queer identity, *nasty* break-up, etc), I ended up *severely* depressed during just that first semester. So much so that I was skipping classes and even skipping *midterms.* Obviously, my GPA tanked. Professors and advisors reached out to try and help, and I blew them all off with excuses about 'family emergencies, work, blah blah' whatever bullshit excuse I could think of, anything but admit that I was incredibly suicidal. 

A short time later, I was put on Financial Aid Hold, which is was alerted my parents to the situation. I finally told the professors and advisors the truth about my situation, and they pretty unanimously suggested I Medically Withdraw from school. After a few counselling sessions, that is what I did. 

  
Now, here I am, years later, with no degree and wanting to go back to school. I'm worried, however, about my chances of being accepted to a new school with my record. Do any of the aforementioned things impact my likelihood of being accepted, or impact my likelihood of receiving financial aid? If so, is there anything I can do to.... 'fix' it? What are my options?

___


Edit: (unnecessary little vent, entirely irrelevant to the main point of my post ‚Äî just reflecting back):


It‚Äôs really daunting and frustrating to be 26, and finally begin to realize just how much my choices as an 18 year old are still messing with my future today. I have grace and kindness for that 18 year old ‚Äî they were an absolute wreck, confused, lonely, angry, careless. But that 18 year old also pretty royally messed up their own future. I wish I had taken a gap year rather than jump right into college at 18 when I wasn‚Äôt even sure I *wanted* to go to college; I wish I‚Äôd been honest with my professors right when the trouble started, because maybe then there would have been the chance to save my grades. Frankly, I wish I‚Äôd never chosen CCU lol, for a lot of other reasons. 

Because now, it feels as though that angry and sad little teen burned all my bridges.

"Is finishing college completely at 26 bad?","I'm making this post for advice and to vent but just right now my aunt asked me when I'll be done with school and I said that I'm going to be at community college for 3 years, and transfer to another college for another 4 years most likely. Also, I know it's usually 2 years, but I don't want to pressure myself, so I just extended it for myself and to do take more electives, is that bad too?

I started going to college right after I graduated high school, so I started at 18. I am currently 19 years old. And who knows if I'll continue to go back to school for another art degree but I'm not that far yet.. 

My major is studio art, but I want to change it to either illustration or maybe ceramics. Illustration is the most likely one but still unsure. But is finishing school complete at age 26 as an art major bad? I'm one to overthink such a simple thing and I might be overthinking this soon. It hasn't gone far to the point, I'll just start texting my best friend late at night.

"I think I fucked up...","I might have failed two classes this quarter. I don't know my grade yet. I am PANICKING. I might not get to switch to my intended major. And what happens when you fail? I'VE NEVER EVER FAILED A CLASS EVER IN MY LIFE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

And it's not even like I have a good reason, I've just been extra down in the dumps this quarter and falling off because it was spring. I don't party or anything. I don't have some severe family tragedy occuring. I went to every lecture. But I don't have very good study skills and these classes were hard. I have just kind of been a zombie attempting to go through the motions. I've been dropping the ball in other areas of life too. I have nothing to show for any of this.

My professors haven't finished grading, so maybe there's hope. But the suspense is killing me and I'm also planning on taking summer classes. I want to get internships and stuff sometime but with these grades I probably never will. I feel like I'm drowning. Help.

"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here. I just feel like a loser. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l8w54k/i_think_i_need_help/","1749656934.0","CollegeRant","temporaryboi_"

"Why aren't AP scores seen as of greater/equal importance to SAT/ACT scores?","I'm a rising senior, and I've been facing a dilemma with my current ACT score. I scored a 27. It's not a terrible score, but I don't necessarily believe it fully demonstrates my academic abilities. In contrast, my AP scores are objectively stellar. I have taken six AP exams thus far and scored 5's on 5 of them (Bio, World History, Human Geography, APUSH, and Language and Composition) and a 4 on AP Calculus AB. I was originally going to submit the 27 and call it a day, but then I found out that a current senior I knew got into ZERO of the colleges she applied to, and she attributes her rejections to her ACT score of 28. Now it's got me nervous, and now I've been thinking of applying test-optional and submitting all my AP scores instead. Recently, I've been seeing a few posts on this subreddit claim that AP scores DO NOT matter when compared to SAT/ACT scores. Why is that? Both tests accomplish the same thing as standardized tests. Won't a 5 on the APUSH, World History, and Language and Composition exams prove I have college-level reading comprehension and writing skills? Won't a 4 on calculus AB prove that I'm ready for college-level math? I don't understand the double standard. If anyone could enlighten me, that would be very much appreciated.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1lvmnv5/why_arent_ap_scores_seen_as_of_greaterequal/","1752077119.0","ApplyingToCollege","Timely_Beat_6921"
"What is the point of trying in HS if I'm going to a CC?","this is my first reddit post so i'll preface this by saying idk how to word this sorry haha. I'm currently a rising senior in high school (f17) and I've gotten straight A's my whole academic career + ap/honor classes with a pretty solid list of extracurriculars. In the future, my goal is to be in the medical field. With that, I'd always planned on going to a 4-year university but due to Trump's BBB and my own financial issues I've started to reconsider CC as an option. 

I know deep down in my heart CC is definitely the smarter option (esp the money-saving aspect) but I feel like all my efforts in high school were all a waste if I went to CC. What was the point of trying in HS? All the long nights of studying and stress I endured js for it to not count makes me feel kinda sad. On top of that i feel like I'll have extreme fomo from missing the ""college experience"" but thats prob the least of my issues compared to student debt lol. I've also heard people saying it's harder to form relationships for opportunities/internships once they transferred to a university because ppl were alr there before them. But yeah I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get at here maybe a little advice or comfort about going to a CC? Or should I go to a 4-year anyway?? Thoughts?

"Had bad grades in highschool but its been a while.","So I am looking to apply to some colleges and wanting to get back on track with my life goals. I graduated highschool by the skin of my teeth 4 years ago. The bad grades where honestly due to poor mental health and dealing with a nearly fulltime job at the same time. But that was a few years ago now and I feel like things have changed so much for me, is there ways I can get around these grades being a blemish on me applying to schools? Or am I overthinking and I will be fine especially being I had good testing scores. I also constantly get hit with the question of academic references and I doubt teachers even remember me much less could act as a reference for me.

My dream is to get into a school and seek my dream of palentology, but every school reccomendation I get for it feels like I would just be turned away for my grades.

"I'm so lost... I don't know what to do for my college application...","I'm a high school senior in the US. I have a 1500+ SAT and nearly a 4.0 UW GPA, but due to a rough start during my freshmen year (where i took all on levels and didnt get the weighted GPA boost), my class rank is around top 10%. Im trying to apply to some Ivies and some well reputated schools like MIT, Georgia Tech, Purdue for computer science.

As for my ECs, thats where I am a bit worried. A huge chunk of my time outside of school went to my FRC robotics team. this past year we did win district events and made it to the World Championship, and even won some awards like Impact etc., but I'm worried that these are team awards and won't show much for me individually.

I've also done some volunteer work and i have over 100 hours in my school red cross chapter (where I also have a leadership position) and volunteered at some stem/lego camps tutoring kids. I also worked on a passion project for one of my classes where I 3d modeled a concept and programmed a simulation . Thats basically the gist of my ECs. I know, it's not a lot. 

  
I dont know where to start or what to do that would make me stand out. I know theres a lot of options for extracurrciulars, but with my given time-frame I don't know how possible it is. My dad has been screaming at me about researching and posting blogs, but I dont know where to start with ""research"" or even what even is the standard for posting. I've looked up examples but they all seem different and complex and definetly not do-able within the given time frame.

  
If you think its too late and the top schools I listed are out of reach, you can say that aswell. I'm not going to be super upset if I dont get into the top schools since I have some decent instate options, but my parents are very traditional and they keep talking to their friends and how all their kids are going to MIT, Harvard, Princeton etc. It's not like I'm trying to be a dissapointment but with the way my parents have been yelling at me to get my act together and seeing how other kids are getting into top schools I just feel like a failure.

Any honest feedback is appreciated. Thank you.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1lw1vw4/im_so_lost_i_dont_know_what_to_do_for_my_college/","1752115829.0","ApplyingToCollege","No-Following666"
