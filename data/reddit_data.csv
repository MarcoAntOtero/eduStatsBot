"Are we at risk for another Kent State?","With protests growing across the country, the government response is becoming more and more militarized. We’ve seen ICE, the National Guard, LAPD, and now reports of 700 Marines being deployed to Los Angeles. In Chicago, demonstrations are gaining momentum. And on June 14, a large military parade is planned costing well over 45 millions dollars, marking both Trump’s birthday and the U.S. Army’s founding.

What’s deeply concerning is the president’s public statement threatening to use “heavy force” against any protestors present that day. Given the buildup, it’s hard not to wonder: could we be approaching a situation where something like Kent State happens again?

This isn’t about predicting violence for shock value, it’s about asking, seriously, how close we are to seeing an escalation where the line between crowd control and tragedy is crossed.

And for those who support the president, I’m genuinely asking: how do you view this kind of rhetoric? Where do you draw the line when it comes to using force against peaceful protest?","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1l925t4/are_we_at_risk_for_another_kent_state/","2025-06-11 19:44:09","GenZ","Chewboi_q"
"Yo writing in cursive is dope","I started journaling a couple years ago, and 3 weeks ago started writing in cursive just because the younger generations don't learn it. I kind of started it as a cryptic joke for my future grandkids, like ""lol good luck deciphering that"" but I gotta say. Focusing on each word you write, because you can't screw up start to finish, changes the way you think.

The turmoil in our day and age is a lot, more than I think anybody who didn't grow up in it would understand compared to the past. Not because of the specific events, but because of the cultural shift from pen and paper to endless electronics and ads and propaganda. We and the millennial generation witnessed it firsthand, and were too young to really have a say, all the answers would be provided, so long as we finished college. Then the generation behind us pulled the ladder, just like the boomers did for them, but the system is failing and we're not sitting at the adult table. I'm going to turn 27 this year and I'm finally starting to feel respected as an actual adult by the older generations. 

Edward Rutledge was 26 when he signed The Declaration of Independence. Imagine if you signed a piece of paper right now that determines the future of the world 2 and a half centuries later. 

All I'm saying is, cursive is dope, and y'all should teach your kids, they might be the next Benjamin Franklin.","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1l8oz6n/yo_writing_in_cursive_is_dope/","2025-06-11 10:16:06","GenZ","zupcus"

"Disappointed in myself and stuck. How to move forward?","I'm currently in my Work-Integrated Learning term of my program. So far, I thought we have been doing good as a group and have been told that we've been working hard, until recently. 

In the beginning we were given training/demo videos of about 25+ hours worth of time of coding to prep us for our actual work. There was instructions that we will be graded eventually, at first I was on top of everything, but got too comfortable when weeks have passed and we didn't get checked for those coding repository. I at first followed with coding, but eventually just watched and took notes of the videos since it might take me too long and some extra work came early to us.

Well, my instructor checked mine and I barely had something to show and it did not got well. I was told I would already be considered a fail since we had a minimum grade for the term and the training were a chunk of that. He still gave me extension and I admit to that mistake on my part. Also, it was the same for my other group members and I'm pretty sure other groups as well, however, their work won't be graded until next week.

I've never been in this kind of situation before, so everything was very heavy on my mental health. I really thought we were doing good, but turns out we didn't ""look"" to be taking our work seriously and was only doing an ""okay"" job.

Just to give some context, while a few of my groupmates have been late almost every day, and some haven’t been putting in much effort, I’ve been doing my best to stay on track and do our work. I haven’t been late and have contributed as much as I can. I ask most of our questions and have answered most of our instructors questions. That’s why I wasn’t sure if our instructor’s feedback was meant for all of us or more for specific situations. He did mention that we still have a chance if we change our trajectory now. But I’m still a bit confused about where exactly we’ve fallen short aside from the missed training, of course. In our activities, he would say to take our time, or no pressure, and that we've been working hard.

That said, I won’t deny that I’ve fallen short by not doing my training. I just want to ask for some guidance on how to move past the shame I’m feeling and get back to acting ""normal"" again. I tend to be really hard on myself and have noticed that I struggle with taking criticism without taking it personally.

"Is taking a break from work during college a bad idea?","I’m about to start my junior year as an accounting major and there's a concern. My classes are about to get wayyy harder and I know I’ll need to put most of my time into studying if I want to keep my grades up.

So far I've only had 2 jobs, one as a library assistant (5 months)  and another as an admin assistant (1 year).

"Does your major require much screen use?","
For context, I had to drop out of college three years ago after starting my sophomore year, because almost every class in both majors I tried out (Musical theatre and Psych) required 90% of the work to be done on a computer. I’m not sure why, but I just haven’t been able to handle computers well since they started getting implemented into daily schoolwork when I was in middle school. Proficiency isn’t the issue. Sitting in front of a screen almost all day, almost every day, just severely impacted my mental wellbeing. It took me until very recently to realize that screens were the cause. I used to insist on handwriting all my assignments until I was forced to give up. Burnt out shortly after. 

Since then, I’ve waitressed, cashiered, bar-backed, barista-d, and now I unload trucks and stock shelves overnight.

I’d love to be able to find an education and long-term job that doesn’t demand staring at a screen for most of the work. I can handle a good amount of occasional/dynamic screen use at my job, but sitting in front of a monitor for 4+ hours a day is something I burn out of quickly. 

Maybe the answer is obvious to many people, but in my experience, even if a certain job doesn’t require a lot of screen use, the education still seems to (which, in my case, makes the job practically inaccessible). I don’t know anyone else who is in this situation. Most people I know seem to get along fine sitting in front of a screen for extended periods. 

So, genuine question: Is there anyone out there earning their degree with little to no time spent in front of a screen? And if so, could you say what and/or where you’re studying? 

Edit: yes, I’m aware that screens have taken over everything. I’m looking for something with LESS screens. Trades are an option, yes, just not ideal. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1l8n656/does_your_major_require_much_screen_use/","2025-06-11 08:15:09","college","Onadism"
"Engineering majors who struggled with math: How did you rebuild your foundation and start enjoying it?","Hey everyone,
I’m currently in my second semester of university as a Computer Science major, and I’ve failed both the preschool/basic math and physics course and the main math course in these two semesters.

Back in high school, I was a science major, but honestly, I never really understood math well I was just trying to pass. Now in college, it’s catching up with me hard. I struggle even with the basics like algebra and functions, and because of that, I’ve developed a real frustration and even hate toward math. Every time I try to study, I just feel dumb and discouraged.

But I know that math is essential in CS, and I don’t want this to ruin my degree or career path. So for those of you who were in a similar situation:

How did you actually start learning math from the ground up in college?

What topics should I start with to rebuild my basics?

Any resources (YouTube channels, courses, books, etc.) that made math click for you?

How did you change your mindset to not hate math and maybe even enjoy it?


Right now I feel like I’m at zero and falling behind. I’m willing to put in the work, but I need a roadmap and some hope that it’s not too late.

"How do I go to college If I want to move?","Very curious and lost on this one.

Starting off, my family is very toxic and I dearly want to move away as fast as possible. They’ve been forcing college down my throat since I was 10, as they both dropped out. Don’t get me wrong, I’m fine with going to college.Though, when I brought up some good colleges in range of price(That I offered to pay for.), My parents would always shoot them down. 
Some of them were out of state, leaving me to move away and go into dorms, others were barely an hour out. Instead, they insisted on this community college that would frequently visit my high school.
 At some point they did say that they would be paying for it, but I soon found out that they were going to fully put the bill in my name and leave me with it. (I don’t expect them to pay no, but forcing me to go to a college that you say you’ll be paying for then going back on your word is kinda rude.)
I finally signed up for classes to get them to be quiet about it, I know they mean well and they’re trying to let me be successful, but sometimes it feels like they’re doing all this so I can’t leave them.

Though, I soon thought about what if I just moved away? 
Well, theres a lot of complications with that, but the main one being money. 
Well, I could apply for a full-time job. Save for a while, then move out.

But, what about college? I would be shackled down for two years if I went through with this, yes of course I can wait, but do I really want to live in my parents household for that long? 

“Well What about moving out and staying near the college?” - I hate that I know everyone here, I rather get out of this state and see more than just a small run down town every single day for the next two years.

This is where I am stumped, do I ask my community college if I can fully go online? Or ask for them to transfer me to an online college? (I’ve heard from some reddit posts that community colleges try to get you to deposit money to trap you with them, but I’ve paid them nothing so far.)
Or maybe I save up from said full time job and just go to college in the state that I move to when I finally move?

My goal is to get an associates degree in radiologic technology, so I can become an MRI Tech, which I know will need some in person credits.

Im genuinely just scared for my future, I don’t want to throw away my freedom and be working 24/7 to live, but I surely don’t want to be living with parents that belittle me at their convenience. 

I apologize if this is not enough info to grasp the situation at hand, I really am trying not to overshare but to keep things to a minimum. Though, do ask questions if needed, I just need to find a solution and a better answer than google ai. 

I also apologize if reading this was hard for anyone, i tried sectioning things up to make it sound okay-ish in my head!!","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1l8943v/how_do_i_go_to_college_if_i_want_to_move/","2025-06-10 20:15:22","college","Training-Ad4996"

"Heads up for future college students or those thinking about college. This is about the new OBBB Act","Currently reading the entire act. If this passes into law, subsidized loans will no longer apply to undergrad students, only unsubsidized. Grad/ Professional students will no longer be able to get Federal Direct Plus Loans. 

Exeptions:

Students who:
	1.	Are already in college as of June 30, 2026, and
	2.	Have already received a federal student loan for their current program (or had one taken out for them)

Exeption length:

They can keep borrowing under the old rules (before the loan changes) for whichever of these is shorter:
	1.	Three more school years, OR
	2.	However long it should take them to finish their current program
	•	Example: If the degree takes 4 years and they’ve already finished 2, they get 2 more years of the old loan access.

🚨*EDIT* Additional relevant info from u/icanimaginewhy ""Additional relevant information: Pell Grant eligibility will be made more difficult by raising the semester credits needed for full-time status to 15, and it completely eliminates the grant for students at less than half-time status. Also, the maximum grant amount itself would be cut from $7,395 to $5,710. About 40% of undergraduate students receive Pell Grants, so this will increase the need for student loans significantly.

Also the bill would increase the college endowment tax from 1.4% to 21%. For those of you that are not aware, endowments are mostly used to fund internal student scholarships. This massive hike would mean colleges would have significantly less money available for student aid. This will also increase the out-of-pocket costs for college students and their need for student loans.""

"Is gap year worth-it?","HELLO!

I am an **international (southeast asian)** student who has just applied to U.S colleges and Italian universities (undergrad). As you can see, I am contemplating a gap year. I was not accepted to any colleges in the U.S and accepted to **2 in Italy**. I was almost ready to commit to Sapienza when I realized the living situation there. I heard from many people that there is no accommodation, and if there is, I have to share it with a million people. On top of that, Rome is hella expensive, so I cannot deal with the financial guilt while I am in a country that is entirely foreign to me. I have a bad feeling that I might be drained mentally if I choose Italy.

So I started contemplating a gap year. I know a lot of people take gap years and turn out absolutely fine, but there is this fear in the back of my mind saying that I will fail, get *lonely* asf, and just fall into a deep mental health crisis. I know I am lowk overthinking this, but there is this fear that I am taking a HUGE RISK by committing to a gap year experience.

My parents are telling me to study here in my country, but I don't see any point in doing so. I am planning to gain a lot of **work experience**, figure out my intended major, and apply to a lot of **European universities and a few U.S. and Asian universities as well**. I am just a bit unsure whether European and Asian scholarship programs and universities view my gap year as a bad thing.

So, I want to ask the following:

1. Will taking a gap year hurt my chances of getting into colleges (European and Asian unis)? Is there any specific policy against gap year?  
2. Best advice for me regarding keeping sane throughout my gap year?  
3. Do you think a gap year is worth it?

"Should I withdraw now or wait it out?","Hey! I need some advice. I'm about to go into my 5th and final year of my degree, and I'm taking two courses right now. One is a 6-week spring course for my major, and the other is a 13-week statistics course that is just an elective. I did not have the high school prerequisite for this stats course, but took it anyway on advice from other students. My school doesn't have the type of advisors who give the best advice about this stuff, so I never ended up getting a professional opinion. 

As of right now, I'm not failing this stats course, but it's really draining to do the online assignments, and I'm not sure how I'll pass my midterm in June. I have cried every time I've sat down to do an assignment. It's just so hard, and I don't have the background for it. Part of me wants to withdraw now so that I can focus on work (job is in my field and flexible) and the other class, while part of me wonders if I should try to work hard and turn it around. 

Part of what makes me anxious is that my first year was BAD. I took 6 classes and got 2 Ds, 1 F, and 3 Ws. That can be explained away on grad school apps, but I'm concerned that taking a 4th W so late in the game is really going to hurt me. I just made Dean's List this year, so I almost feel like I improved tremendously just to drop the ball again.

Don't worry, I know that a W is better than an F or even a D or C, and I won't let that happen, but I am concerned that pouring 2 more months into a class just to withdraw will make me feel like I wasted my time being miserable, while withdrawing now will make me feel guilty and like I wasted an opportunity to grow. I would really appreciate some advice or words of wisdom. My graduation timeline, money, etc. are not part of my considerations. It's pretty much just that I feel like crap about this situation and wish I could go back in time and drop this class before the drop deadline. I have a feeling that I'm being silly though and just need some clarity from an outsider.

"Scared","Im an Incoming freshman majoring in pre-med chemistry, and Im very scared about the rigor of my classes. 

I'm coming out of high school with an associates degree through a local community college. Because of this, I have all of my basics done, and looking at my degree audits for chemistry Im worried it'll be too much.

To finish out my degree I need to take (along with a a handful of other courses);

Gen Chem
O Chem
IO Chem
P Chem
Bio Chem
Calc 3
Diff Eqs
Stats
Phys

I understand that classes get progressively harder, what Im most concerned about is the sheer VOLUME of classes that I'll have to take at once. All of my electives/cores are done for the most part, and it feels like Ill be taking multiple incredibly difficult classes at once, which frankly scares the hell out of me.

Im worried that Ill preform poorly because of it. Im worried that my freshman year of college will get the fun drained out of it by the workload of 8+ chemistry/math courses.

Overall I just have a lot of anxiety heading into college (unique ik), and I feel like Ive dealt myself a bad hand getting all of my easy classes out of the way, meaning I have nothing to fill in the gaps around the hard ones.

Are these fears unfounded? I guess Im looking for advice on how to handle it, or even if it's something I should be worrying about. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

"Struggling After School Shooting","Title summarizes it.

My school had a shooting about a month and a half ago, and I had the misfortune of being in the building it happened while it was happening. My mental health is very fragile right now. I tried pushing through my trauma and doing summer courses this semester, but my first day on campus led me to have a severe mental breakdown that night and I figured that I was not ready. I'm still in my collegetown but am planning to go back to my hometown for the rest of summer.

My concern is that I will never be ready to go back. I love my school, I love the academics here, I love the culture and community, and I love my friends. I'm currently going to therapy and I know that it won't be an overnight quick fix, but I have this overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety when i think about the fall semester and having to be back on campus. I have nightmares frequently. It's gotten so bad that I went on an accidental bender trying to run away from the dark thoughts at night.

I don't want to do anything rash. I'm stuck in this hard situation of wanting to get my degree from this university that I've put blood, sweat, and tears into-- especially because i'm about three more semesters to finishing or moving near my family and finishing up school at another university. Although I love my current university, I don't feel safe and I don't think I'll ever feel safe again. It will never be the same again, and I feel like a husk of myself right now.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice, or for someone to be logical with me, but idk. im struggling. I wish this never happened.","https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1l6r8dw/struggling_after_school_shooting/","2025-06-09 00:25:35","college","stoikheinbreast"

"My immigrant mother is trying to enroll in college but is getting no proper help. What can we do?","My mother is from Afghanistan and recently received her university transcript back. She had her documents translated and sent them to CCBC (Community College of Baltimore County) and another institution (I don’t remember the name) for verification. The documents were verified.

She didn’t tell me exactly which classes she took back in Afghanistan that might count toward her major, but she’s hoping to study nursing here. When she went to CCBC to enroll in classes, the staff didn’t offer her much help. One counselor told her that her previous classes don’t count for anything and that she has to start over from the beginning.

My mom doesn’t speak English fluently, and she hasn’t been able to meet with a healthcare advisor specifically just general counselors who didn’t guide her properly. It feels like she's being brushed off.

Is there a program or office that gives extra assistance to immigrants or people with foreign transcripts to help them move forward with their major? Any advice or resources would mean a lot.

"My experience as a 16 year old late bloomer","So basically I'm 16 years old, I'm in 9th grade because I have to repeat it since I failed most of my subjects last year but that's not the point, (sorry if my English is not the best I'm only B1)


So far I didn't like my life, I got bullied alot during 7th and 8th grade because I was shorter than everyone else and even now some people hate me because I'm short and have an high pitched voice as a 16 years old in a class full of people that are a year younger than me.

The thing that upsets me the most is that I could never get a girlfriend once I reached 7th grade, I never felt loved by any girls or even by my ""friends"" or classmates, I usually think I'm awkward because people never come to talk to me but I'm always searching for someone to talk to, I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna look like a loser more than I already am.

Each year I fall in love with a girl and they end up with another guy and the cycle always repeats itself, I have developed incel behaviour as I despise other girls for not liking me for something that is not my fault, and I understand that I should not behave this way since it's their right to love someone who's ""normal"".

As depressing my life sounds I actually found positive things about it, the fact that I don't feel loved by anyone has given me motivation on becoming better over the last past year I've been working alot on my appearance and I have some kind of obsession about my look and I just wanna look the best since this is the only way for me to be loved.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1l940jg/my_experience_as_a_16_year_old_late_bloomer/","2025-06-11 20:59:11","highschool","RandomGuy7800"

"Korean middle school student with no money U.S. high school full scholarship question (with translator)","Hello I am a middle school student who only holds a single Korean nationality and I don't seem to have many places to get information and grok, gpt, etc. sometimes lie or say something too unrealistic, so I ask on reddit First of all, I want to immigrate to the United States and assimilate eventually through studying in the United States So for that, I think it is good to live in the United States from as early as possible, so I decided to study in the United States, But even if I went to a really cheap place, the cost of one year's tuition + non-dormitory fees was about 2000 million won. That's for one year, and I only paid for tuition and dormitory fees, so I need more wheelchairs to continue going to school. But my family doesn't have much money. I have about 3500 million won in debt, and my mother's salary is about 200 million won. I don't have much money saved, and the house is about 1500 million won, As a result of further research on the Internet, I found that there are schools that provide full scholarships if the family income is low. Representatively, prestigious universities such as the Ivy League, high schools such as UWC, However, this is not definite information, and I know that most of these schools are prestigious and very difficult to enter. And I think that the Korean curriculum is not very helpful for me as I aimed for the Korean SAT. Therefore, what I thought was to homeschool the middle school course with an American online school after the middle school administrator outside the middle school capacity, and enter UWC or a mid-range American boarding school that provides a full scholarship, and enter an American university that provides a full scholarship, After graduation, my goal is to get a job in the U.S., get a green card through employment-based immigration, join the military, get a green card, live in the U.S. for a long time, and become a U.S. citizen. I'm not sure if this plan is realistic, but I think it's the best option for me without money. Most of the articles on the Internet about studying abroad assume that you have a lot of money. I've read books about studying in the U.S., but they also assume that you have a lot of money, so there aren't many articles about studying abroad for people without money like me, so I couldn't help but ask ChatGPT and make a plan Naturally, I don't think everything ChatGPT says is true, but I can't help it And the cost of the previous plan is about 300,000 won for 2-3 months of language training in the Philippines, I know that it costs about 200-400 million won for one year of tuition at an online school in the United States. If you have a good foundation in English, you will naturally increase if you do an online school in the United States. Of course, I will also learn English other than online school. And it is also possible to become an immigrant to the United States through studying in other English-speaking countries other than the United States or immigration, I would like to ask if this is possible, and if it is not realistic, please let me know what other options are available. And I think this post is very unrealistic and may sound like a translator I used a translator and it is not meant to be a joke.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1l8ol6a/korean_middle_school_student_with_no_money_us/","2025-06-11 09:51:47","highschool","Left_Professional_59"
"Shitting my pants over final exam marks and it feels out of my control","Idk less of a rant and more of a vent but I just want to see if anybody empathizes with me rn.

I have been trying to work my ass off this semester, constantly. But I always feel so god damn tired, exhausted and upset. No matter what I do with the energy I have, I do not get good marks back this semester unless the class is on easy mode x100.

I'm going to community college regardless anyway afterward to recover my math credit as there was an error and I was placed in the wrong class. (It was at an appropriate grade level, it was just a non academic credit, which I need to apply to university.)

To apply to all the unis here for a science major, I also need an english 12 mark worth 80% and a biology 12 mark worth 80%. I was pumped, I thought I could do this because english and bio were strengths for me, and bio in particular I loved and I wanted to do something related to that after school. But before this semester I was already getting kicked down by applications and admins because I constantly got hit with ""do not go to university"" because of my math difficulties, (I am disabled) which already discouraged me heavily. Then when I took english 12 the first time, I got below 80% and I was devastated. I literally was so upset that I cried about it for maybe two days. I have literally never gotten below 80 in an english class, never in my entire god damn life.

But I picked myself up, admitted it was my fault due to me being disorganized, and applied for it again this semester.


This semester rolls around, I am still struggling. Granted my english marks are better and my teacher voiced that he saw a major improvement in my studies and work effort, but I still have below an 80. I have only 3 missing assignments, which werent weighted much, because I had to sacrifice for my other classes.

Biology 12 is a nightmare. My teacher, now, he frustrates me but I know he is just doing his job. But I stg, the way he weighs things is so bullshit. And he has wrecked almost every single kid I know.
One of the smartest guys in my class (we are talking 98-100% average. Wins science and math awards every year.) literally saw me do bio work in english when I had no other work to do, and he went ""Is that bio with ____?"" I replied ""yes"".

 He literally physically recoiled, and told me that the class screwed him over so bad, that his avg in that class literally reduced by almost *20 percent* because of the way he grades. We even had a girl who constantly excelled drop out of the class this semester because she worried it would hurt her GPA. I had one tell me she studied for almost a month, and got a 40 on the final exam. I even had a guy who is taking chemistry in uni, who went to my school, literally tell me I was cooked when I mentioned I had this teacher.

Ever since I took this class, my math grade has been like 10% HIGHER than my biology mark, which realistically should *not* be happening but it is.

I have cried over not doing well in the class so many times this semester that even looking at my homework in this class sent me into panic mode. I would cry in my car before having to go in, etc. Its god damn ridiculous and I hate feeling so shameful. My self worth and esteem is down to the floor, and I feel so stupid compared to everyone else.

I know this is bad, but I am seriously considering not studying for the exam and commiting academic sepukku in this class. Not because I want to fail, but because I am done. And I know I am going to have to take the class anyway regardless of if I pass or not if I don't get that 80%, which I am like 30 points away from. It is literally not happening, and I do not need the class to graduate. I think I will get an 80 in english atleast, since my mark was 75% last I checked and that was not even after he graded all of my other like 18 assignments that I turned in. And I got 90 on the exam last semester and it is the same exam outline this semester.

But honestly my fears are seriously making me worried if I am cut out for course recovery this fall. I am literally so burnt out. I don't have any other future career ideas or passions. I was encouraged by my teachers to get into law because of my high politics class marks, but I know math will hold me back. My family is supposed to celebrate me grading, but I am worried I am going to crash out once I see my final marks.

I am lost.","https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1l8icde/shitting_my_pants_over_final_exam_marks_and_it/","2025-06-11 03:16:01","highschool","Ang3l_st0ckingz"
"I feel like a failure","i go to a very, very small school. a little over half of the students in the graduating class are in NHS. i feel so stupid because i'm not in it. i begged them to put me in honors classes this year (its confusing at my school, you either take all honors or no honors) because i knew i could do it and they said that it was full (only 9 students are allowed in honors/every class). 

i graduated yesterday with a 3.4 and i dont feel any better about it. i shouldve just repeated a year.

freshman year i wasnt at that school and was at public school where i was struggling. i was put into the psych ward twice that year and only had an hour of time to do schoolwork a week. when i got back, they locked me in a small room to do the missing work, effectively causing me to miss more work. freshman year brought down my gpa dramatically, making me unable to get into nhs despite having all A's in 10-12th grade. 

this doesnt mean anything though — my school is a therapeutic school. everyone is weird and has their own struggles, many probably worse than mine, and they still have managed to surpass what i have done.

throughout elementary and most of middle school i was an exemplary student. my grades were my only way to have any self esteem because i didnt have any in other areas, largely in part because of undiagnosed autism, depression, and body dysmorphia. i now have nothing to like myself for.

im at a point where im considering killing myself. im going to a college with 70% acceptance and i keep seeing people on social media getting into much better schools. its worse because i know if i was in a better mental state i could've been them. i know im smart enough to have made it to the same heights they have, but i ruined it for myself and there is no way to redo it.

i dont know what to do. people keep telling me i can just do well in college to make up for how i was in high school but im afraid im going to lose motivation and fail out of college. because my school is small there were no comp sci classes so i have no experience in my major at all. 

i dont see any other future for me besides ending it now.

"Can't take any math classes because of my gpa- Struggling to manage high school","For context, I just finished 9th grade at an early college high school with a 2.0 unweighted gpa. I really wanted to take precalculus and calculus next year, and I worked hard in my math class to get above a B in the class and above a 90 on the final. (I got a 97% on the final) My math teacher was constantly telling the class that we needed to pass these requirements to be able to take the class. Then, after thinking I made it, on the last day of school I found out that I won't be able to take precalculus next year because it is offered on the college side and you are required to have a 2.8 unweighted gpa or higher to take collage math classes. Yesterday, I had a conference with the principal, counselor and my mom to ""discuss my options."" They said that I can't take the class online anywhere or retake a class I failed to bring up my gpa up and I can't take any math classes at all next year. (Only junior year if I get my gpa up) If I stay at the school I have to be on a contract and get at least all B's or else I a at risk of getting kicked out.

I don't know what to do. I know it's my fault for getting such bad grades but it's just so difficult to manage all my classes. I don't know how other people do it. I also haven't made any friends the whole year being a quieter person. (the school is very small) The thing is I am deeply passionate about science and animals and I really want to go into that field and go to college, but i'm scared that I won't be able to get much better grades next year. Not being able to take those math classes I actually worked hard for is also very demotivating. Since I won't be taking around half of my classes with my grade, i'm worried that I won't be able to get close to other people and will be alone the whole year again. I want to leave the school but I don't really have any other options. I just feel like a failure because i'm falling behind and even those who are worse in math than me in this school and other schools are going to be able to take those classes next year. If only I knew about this gpa requirement before, I would have tried harder in the classes I thought didn't really matter, like Health and PE.

"My state just banned all personal devices in school","This includes laptops, phones, music players, Chromebooks, audio recorders, ebook readers, etcetera.

I shouldn't even have to explain how stupid this is. I have a 504 plan where I'm allowed to listen to music on a personal device during testing due to anxiety, can't even do that anymore. (Edit: this following part is wrong) Police will be present IN SCHOOLS to enforce this. What the fuck???? They even tried adding a clause that it could be permitted if it's required for the class and it got shot down.

How would they even enforce this? What if someone brings in a calculator, does it get taken too? Where's the line in the sand? This policy is just insane to me.

I wouldn't care all too much if there's restrictions on when and where you can use phones or whatever, that's pretty standard policy and works well in pretty much every school it's applied in, but banning all personal devices at all times with no exception with police enforcement? That's insane, that's genuinely delusional.

The kicker? It got something like 250 to 50 support from the house. 5/6th of our reps were fine with this. Did ANY of them get input from actual students? It's blatant overreach.

The two most cited reasons for the ban were cyber bullying and distractions. For one, cyberbullying doesn't actually happen at school, it happens at home. Nobody goes to school to cyberbully because real bullying is still a thing. Banning all personal devices does nothing about that issue. And secondly, the distractions bit is utter rubbish. As I said before this can easily be solved by either letting teachers ban phones if they want or just banning them during class and not lunch or other breaks. Banning ALL PERSONAL DEVICES for the WHOLE DAY technically does this too, but it's pointlessly strict and cruel for no real reason other than seeing students as mindless drones that only play on their phones and bully people online during school hours.

Edit: Holy shit. Normally I hate addendums added to posts over them blowing up but I think it's warranted when I get 105 notifications in like 12 hours. Thanks for all the karma y'all, much appreciated. And I will add that I heavily rely on personal devices because schools do this thing now where even when nothing is going on in class, you have downtime where you're expected to use a device for entertainment because it's quiet. Can't talk to classmates, can't do anything that could be classified as loud, etcetera. Basically your two options are reading or using your phone and that's about half the day for me since I typically finish my work early. I have minor dyslexia so reading is extremely difficult for me. I can read small things but I have to go over it like 5 or so times pretty slowly and it's really difficult so if I don't have a personal device I'm expected to sit there and do nothing for like 20-30 minutes a period. And also to build on my 504, my freshman year the whole school had banned personal devices and let me listen to music on my school issued Chromebook instead. The issue was that they blocked EVERY SINGLE ENTERTAINMENT WEBSITE. No Spotify, no Apple Music, no YouTube, nothing. My other schools also did this but they didn't ban personal devices so it wasn't a problem, but it will be now that they're being banned statewide. I just shoved an iPod in my bag with a Bluetooth dongle to get around it but if cops are allowed to search and seize personal devices then I'm fucked.

Edit 2: I don't care about cell phones, they should be banned in classrooms unless necessary to the course, I could care less about that. You all are mischaracterizing me because it fits your world view to do so but this is not the case. Phones are in fact distracting and I think there isn't a good reason to have a phone in class. The issue is ANY personal device being banned. Anyone who is assuming I'm some chronically phone addicted kid who needs my digital fix every minute in school is just blatantly wrong. I put my phone on silent and in my bag for the whole school day anyways as to make sure I can focus on class with the very small exception of work related things (like once a month if that, and always outside of class settings.) It's another case of the older generation assuming they know everything about a kids life because they were a kid once and have fuzzy memories of it being fun and we're just overreacting. News flash: times change, boomer. School and social life is not the same as it was when you were a kid.

Edit 3: Apologies for the misinformation, police will NOT be enforcing this, I jumbled up the wording of the article in my head. Governor Ayotte said something along the lines of ""teachers should not have to police phone use in classrooms"" and I misread it. She was also quoted saying that the police bit would be a good idea.

"Funnily enough, looking back I don't remember all the classes I've failed","So in highschool I was an -A student with a few Bs here and there. My GPA was approx 3.75 and I loved school. Fast forward to my first college which was a local community college. My grades dipped, they ignored my disability accomodations, I struggled with online, I struggled with the lack of friends and lack of sense of belonging as it was a commuter school. So I tanked everything and went down to a GPA of 2.34. 

Eventually, I decided they weren't worth my time and transferred to a local university. Still commuting for the sake of money but a bachelor's degree was on the horizon. All of a sudden I had accomodations, success coaches, professors who \*didn't\* encourage me to give up (quite the opposite actually), and I made a few more friends here and there. This school even helped me get the *2 whole associates degrees*  I earned at the community college that they didn't tell me about. Since I transferred so many credits My bachelors degree is technially made up of only 50-ish and my GPA is 2.95 with the semesters usually being around 2.9-3.3. 

Currently I'm applying for a certificate school now that I'm done with my bachelors. Realizing my GPA is still a little low, I went through my transcript and realized I failed 8 classes at community college. *8 whole classes!* Not once was I advised to retake them, actually I was once just told to leave the major entirely. But something about that just makes me feel a little better knowing that a whole new environment gave me the boost I needed. Sure, 2.95 isn't great or ideal, but coming up from 1.97 or 2.34 in 2 years, that's not bad and I hope my next school can see the improvement once I changed schools. That Academically I was able to do better once I was I was in a place where I felt supported and the school actually cared about its students. Hopefully they see the growth and not just the final number","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l9b2f3/funnily_enough_looking_back_i_dont_remember_all/","2025-06-12 02:20:10","CollegeRant","ThrowRAlobotomy666"
"I think I fucked up...","I might have failed two classes this quarter. I don't know my grade yet. I am PANICKING. I might not get to switch to my intended major. And what happens when you fail? I'VE NEVER EVER FAILED A CLASS EVER IN MY LIFE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

And it's not even like I have a good reason, I've just been extra down in the dumps this quarter and falling off because it was spring. I don't party or anything. I don't have some severe family tragedy occuring. I went to every lecture. But I don't have very good study skills and these classes were hard. I have just kind of been a zombie attempting to go through the motions. I've been dropping the ball in other areas of life too. I have nothing to show for any of this.

My professors haven't finished grading, so maybe there's hope. But the suspense is killing me and I'm also planning on taking summer classes. I want to get internships and stuff sometime but with these grades I probably never will. I feel like I'm drowning. Help.

"i think i need help :/","Hi everyone, I'm 19 and currently on summer holidays, starting 3rd year in September. The past 2 years of college have been miserable. I have no friends, no job and I think about hurting or killing myself almost everyday. I also think I might be autistic, but I currently don't have the resources to get a proper evaluation. 

At the start, I really did try to make friends with my classmates, but was unsuccessful. I don't really understand how to behave in most social situations, and when I do end up talking to people, I just get the vibe that they're only interacting with me out of pity and would rather be talking to someone else. It seemed like everybody else managed to quickly find their own friend group while I was just left on my own. There were many social events held during 1st year, but I could never attend as I was still underage at the time. It's painful to see how other people can just effortlessly interact with each other and make friends everywhere they go, while I've never been able to do that and probably never will at this point. 

I sometimes try to sit near other people, but I don't understand how to join in on their conversation and become part of the group. When I was the first to arrive in class, I would pick a seat near the areas that everyone else would sit together, only for them to choose a different spot after seeing me there. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a conversation with a classmate about something unrelated to college. I've cried in class multiple times just out of sheer loneliness and sadness. 

Now that it's summer, I feel even worse. I have nobody to spend time with and I've been rejected from every job I've applied to. It's difficult for me to even get out of bed some days, and the things that used to bring me joy (drawing, writing) just feel impossible now. I don't really no what to do from here. I just feel like a loser. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l8w54k/i_think_i_need_help/","2025-06-11 15:48:54","CollegeRant","temporaryboi_"
"Update to Metadata Saga>","Just wanted to share a quick and honestly kind of hilarious update to my previous rant about my school accusing students of academic dishonesty based on document metadata, shared templates, and even bold text. The most ironic part is that all of this happened in a Social and Legal Relationships in Forensic Science class. A class literally about how evidence and legal systems work was punishing students for things like metadata they didn’t understand, formatting choices, and templates given by the instructor. They were teaching us about due process, burden of proof, chain of custody, and fairness in criminal investigations while simultaneously saying that having two authors listed in a Word document was probably cheating. The standard of evidence they used was ridiculously low basically if something “looked suspicious,” that was enough to accuse students, and the burden was on the students to prove their innocence. If it wasn’t so damaging to students, it would be comedy. They kept insisting the process was educational and not punitive, yet students were flagged, questioned, stressed out, and sometimes penalized for normal things like bolding subheadings or using the provided file. The hypocrisy was wild.  It was lower then even a civil court case. Now that I’m officially an alum, I can fully say I survived the academic integrity circus and the irony that came with it. Thanks for all the support and validation on the last post .You all made me feel way less crazy.

 **TL;DR** The cheating accusations over metadata, templates, and formatting all came from a forensic science class about law and evidence. They used a ridiculously low standard of proof basically just “looks suspicious” was enough to accuse students, and it was up to the students to prove they didn’t cheat. I’m finally an alum and so glad to be done with that nonsense.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l79umx/update_to_metadata_saga/","2025-06-09 16:50:03","CollegeRant","Lumpy-Draft2822"

I failed, all of them, my bio exam, my two art history ones; and boy did I study. Everyday after work I studied and studied and studied until the library closed, reading chapters and looking at quizlets, I took both paper and google doc notes. I fully thought I was prepared for my exams, I was so excited to have this start; I thought I was prepared. Then I failed.

It’s taking a big fat toll on my mood, I know failing exams are apart of life, and how I take that is how I grow as a person. I just can’t believe I did so much only to fall in a vat of failure.

I am 19 and live in Washington state..I've been going to a local community college and I keep failing classes even though I do well on the quizzes and tests+ regular assignments, normally 80% or higher, I've gone for 2 quarters and failed every single class because of some technicality or cause of my disability keeping me from doing work for a couple days (I have a congenital heart condition) I have had a professor tell me to drop her class when I told her I couldn't do work a certain day because of my health issues, I understand that college is different than highschool, but I went to a different college on the opposite side of the state right after graduating HS and they were great, I loved the campus and the professors were understanding and very kind...I could not continue attending due to my health declining due to lack of medical services in the area..
My current college I attend is so difficult for online students, which f ING sucks, my auntie just graduated with her 3rd degree from there and she did not have this hard of a time at all! 

I was trying to look into online universities, the main 2 that come up are FullSail and SNHU which are both way too expensive...are there any good online school options? Due to my disability I have to stay close to my home city...there seem to be no legitimate places for online education, I just don't know what to do...if anyone has suggestions at all that'd be appreciated, I apologise for the long rant..

So im about to start 3rd year but in my second year I failed Discrete Maths(got a D) which just happens to be a prerequisite to Intro to AI, and God help me if that is a prerequisite to something else, so rn I have 2 courses to that I should have been done with by 2nd yr whilst going into 3rd year. I really need to know if this is gonna mess up my timeline and force me into an extension of the four year program or if I would be able to do both courses and anything else withing these next 4 semesters. I have seen a lot of my teammates redoing major courses like oop but idk if they're doing it because they failed or if they're doing it to get a better grade or smth??? 

Also B4 anyone asks why I didn't retake it as soon as possible, that's because it just wasn't being offered in 2nd sem of 2nd year. 

Also if the case happens to be that Intro to AI is a prerequisite(I mean I already found algorithms design to be one for intro to AI although I was still able to register for it on the portal so it seems it's not that strict) to another course then would I still be able to complete all my courses within the 4yr plan despite this.

"Forgetting to comment on one discussion post tanked my grade in an online class by 4%.","After completing my final exam for an online class I'm taking, I looked at Canvas and realized that not commenting on someone's intro discussion post the first week of class cost me 4 percentage points for my grade in the class. 

This ultimately did not affect my letter grade, but I'm still steamed about it on principle. 

This professor has a rule within the class that missing comments on discussion posts will result in a 0 for that assignment. I was extremely busy the first week of class, and somehow I failed to track the due date for comments on the introductory discussion post. You know, the one where you all write ""Hi, my name is so and so, I'm a such and such major, I'm a Libra and my favorite kind of cheese is Gouda. I'm looking forward to taking this class because I want to learn more about how underwater basket weaving is used in tech startups."" I didn't comment on 2 other people's introductions and got docked the entire 10 points for the assignment.

It immediately tanked me to a low B in the class, but I figured that was just because we hadn't done much else yet. Things evened out somewhat over the course of the semester, but I still noticed that it was causing a serious impact to my grade in the class. After working my ass off to make sure that this wouldn't affect my letter grade, today I went to see exactly how much that one tiny mistake had affected things. And the answer is... 4 percentage points. 

I got 100% on all other assignments, As on both exams, and a 92% as my final score (vs a 96%) all due to not commenting on someone's class introduction. I think part of this is that it's a gen ed and a common class for people to take their first semester in college. But even so. Yikes.

"Did really well after shitty semesters, only now am I hit with unsatisfactory progress.","Last year I fucked up pretty bad; got 0.0 GPAs two semesters in a row. The second semester I was sure I was gonna get my aid taken away. Went to my counselor, to the financial aid counselor, to retention, to academic recovery, had about 6 different people ponder over it before all agreeing (with some confusion on how from some) that I, shockingly, would not be USAP'd. I had just barely kept pace and GPA from my barely-afloat semesters. Was sure I'd flunk out this next semester, but... somehow I got a 3.5. Made Dean's list. Some of the classes even felt difficult to me, I remember when I got the email I felt weird. I rediscovered what pride (I'm serious, it was so strange to finally feel like I did something for once. The last time I got above a 70 was in elementary school, I shit you not. Wasn't even supposed to graduate high school. Got into college because of my high ACT).

Anyway. Felt good, then I got a call from a family member saying she got a letter from FASFA saying they're holding back my funding because my progress was unsatisfactory. Turns out changing your schedule in the interim is enough to ruin your pace even if you replace the class - I had placed a genetics course but then changed it for an economics course (same amount of credits). The system counted it as me dropping a class and the system holds drops to a higher weight than additions (this was inbetween semesters, so I never even started the genetics course. Both the classes fall under my major). Now I need to give them proof of those fucked semesters and the proof is medical.

It seems easy, but in my state, I'm legally ""normal"" and ""okay"". In actuality I'm not. I have disabilities and I struggle academically. I don't even like my major. It feels useless, like all my time here is amounting to nothing, because all I do is go to my jobs with brief periods of doing homework. I don't really learn from my classes, I just do it because if I don't I'll get fired and kicked onto the curb. I want to like learning and I want to feel like I'm doing something with my degree, but it's hard. Harder than it should be. I can barely remember to feed myself or shower, but according to the state I should be able to. I don't know what sort of proof I can give them. I've been to several therapists, had a psychologist and neurologist at one point. They all agreed I have disabilities (one of them, the psychologist, even said I was the poster child to one of them and was shocked when I told her I was completely okay). None of them could give medicine though - they could diagnose but they couldn't prescribe the medication that could make me better. I'd have to travel hours or get on a better insurance plan to go to the place nearby.

So I'm just. Tired. I managed to get lucky and was lucid enough to do one semester, but the moment I feel proud of myself for besting the odds, now I'm being told I got 2 months to figure out how to show proof of a disability that even if they believe I have, that I can totally go without medicine for, because there's no way I can get it. I'm already behind and on my 5th year in a major and in classes I can't find myself enjoying even though they're all things I like. This career path I have is so blurry and planless that I can't fathom seeing it actually exist in reality. I wish I had help with these things when I was younger so when I got to college I could spend my time actually having that college experience and putting myself into my learning, but instead I had to fight the solo battle while trying to pretend to be healthy to my professors.

I'm exhausted from being a fuckup all the damn time, even when I succeed it comes with surprise drawbacks man. I wish my college difficulties could be a big paper or a shitty group project and not trying to explain how sometimes I just can't move to my professors and hoping they get it (on a side note, most of them are understanding. I only had one prof my freshman year disagree but he also called me a re**** in front of the entire class for asking him to explain a math problem and berated me for 30 minutes saying I might as well drop out now so I could beg the Mcdonalds for a job. He taught solely remedial classes and was fired from the local highschool for slapping a disabled student, so I don't hold his words highly).

on a positive prof note one of them clocked my disabilities so much that he advocated for me to the disability department and helped write my proof letters for getting time and a half on exams (the best they could give me) because he noticed how i struggled in his class. fucking g, though found during the winter break he thought i was one of the highschoolers in the class (i was the oldest). we had a good chuckle about it.

"I didn’t finish in time and now I probably never will","I did four years. I completed 122 credits but because everyday of those four years was full of surgeries, mental and physical health issues, and active recurring trauma, I only earned 96 of those credits. I didn’t graduate on time. Now needing a fifth year I’ve lost more than half of my financial aid. I’ve only been able to attend because it’s been completely covered by the school’s scholarships and federal/state grants and loans. I appealed to the financial aid board and it’s been a month of silence. No response to my follow up. I’ve been trying to accept that I could just be done and I’m not going back to finish or that my degree will have to be from another school. I am so ashamed and embarrassed. My family is aware of everything but I haven’t said anything about how I feel because it’s just too much. Not going to grad school for social work and not even being able to finish my fucking undergrad will now be even more things I kept saying I would do and failed. 

I’ve been looking into other schools within commuting distance but they either cost too much, don’t accept enough transfer credits, or they do but have so many additional requirements I’d be there for a year and a half to two more years at least. I don’t think I have that in me. I was so burnt out already I wanted to drop out multiple times before I even got to this point. I don’t want to finish because going to school is killing me but I don’t know what else I will do with my life without this career. This shame and uncertainty is so heavy I don’t know what to do with myself. 

All that being said it’s nice to just vent but I need help too. So are there any universities with online programs I could possibly finish at that aren’t diploma mills? It would really suck to just do it to finish and future admissions and employers think I didn’t put any effort in, like people say about SNHU. 

Edit: I’m not sure if this is unclear in the post but my problem isn’t with taking a year to finish my degree it’s the fact that I don’t have the funding for it. It’s $20k that doesn’t exist anymore. I’m also struggling to find a job that pays the bills right now and knowing it will always be like this if I don’t get these degrees is weighing on me too. Job security isn’t guaranteed but chances are high. I am going to send a follow up and probably go to campus next week though to see if I can go to the financial aid office somehow ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l3ydy1/i_didnt_finish_in_time_and_now_i_probably_never/","2025-06-05 12:51:02","CollegeRant","___ilovemycat"
"Do study groups actually work?","Unless the group was managed by a TA, it usually turned into another distraction. At worst we do anything but study, and at best I can barely get anything done because everyone’s just asking each other for hw answers. It feels more like a communal cheating effort rather than actually trying to learn the material.

The only people I hear of that genuinely benefit from study groups are people that slack off and leech off of any student they identify as “the smart kid”. There were times where I was misidentified as this person and invited to a study group where it was clear they expected to use me as a resource, only to realize I was struggling too and I was never invited back.

I’ve also learned I do better when I avoid class group chats bc it’s always 80% distractions and 20% asking for answers. Even that much isn’t even helpful if they aren’t completely walking through the problem step by step, and even if they do, since it’s coming from another student it’s usually wrong.

My current gpa is a 2.5 and honestly I’ve had a really stressful 2.5 years, because my parents were in the process of a divorce and I was working a very toxic on campus job for 2 and a half years and it made me mentally drained and depressed. Now that I’ve changed my major, my mother is mad at me and says I should just drop out because housing is too expensive now that I don’t receive a student employee discount. I just feel no motivation anymore because my previous major has conditioned me into thinking I’m just bad at school. I study, I ask questions, and it’s just never enough and it’s made me realize I’m horrible at everything I do. I met my boyfriend last year and he’s going to graduate soon and go to grad school, and I’m very worried that if I graduate late or something it might put a strain on his plans for a career because we plan to live together. I’m not even sure what i should do. I don’t have a car, I don’t work now, but I’ve been applying and I just feel like an absolute loser. My parents are divorced and they don’t support me, I feel like I’m just lost and I dong know what steps I can take to better my life.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l2wrze/should_i_just_drop_out/","2025-06-04 04:39:10","CollegeRant","Hungry_Egg_4886"
"Walked at graduation  then accused of cheating over a Blackboard doc","I’m beyond frustrated. My school has spent years encouraging students to use Grammarly. Tutors recommended it, professors mentioned it in class, and it was promoted as a tool to help improve grammar and clarity. So for one of my final assignments, I downloaded the required template directly from Blackboard, opened it in Microsoft Word (not Grammarly), completed my work, and submitted it. Then out of nowhere, on Friday, May 30 at 2:30 PM   after I had already walked at graduation .I got hit with an academic integrity charge. The only “evidence” was that the file allegedly contained a Grammarly ID in the metadata. I didn’t even use Grammarly for that file. I just opened the document in Word like I always do. To make it worse, they gave me only five calendar days to respond before the June 6 degree conferral deadline. Not business days  calendar days including a weekend when offices are barely open. And the office handling this closes every day at 4:45 PM, which made it even harder to reach anyone, get advice, or figure out what was actually going on. With no time to properly challenge the accusation and no support from the administration, I had no real choice but to accept an Informal Resolution just to make sure I’d still get my degree on time. I didn’t agree with it, but I didn’t want my graduation held up over something that felt completely out of my control. What really gets me is the total lack of clarity. There was no policy saying Grammarly was banned. In fact, it had been openly encouraged. No warning that file metadata would be used like this. No explanation of how they determined misconduct. It feels like the school is jumping on the AI panic bandwagon and using it to punish students with vague rules and zero transparency. I followed what I believed were the expectations, used school-provided materials, and got penalized anyway. It honestly feels like they were just trying to make an example out of someone   and I happened to be the unlucky one.

**TL;DR:** My school encouraged Grammarly, but then hit me with an academic integrity charge after submitting a Blackboard template I opened in Word. They claimed the file had Grammarly metadata. I got the charge after walking at graduation, had only five calendar days to respond, and the office closed at 4:45 PM. I was forced to accept an Informal Resolution just to get my degree. No warning, no clear policy, and no way to fight back in time.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l2irrg/walked_at_graduation_then_accused_of_cheating/","2025-06-03 17:59:37","CollegeRant","Lumpy-Draft2822"

"Having a shit ending to the semester and don’t know what the fuckk to do","I’m just going to continue to talk about how I as a history major am absolutely flunking this whole thing and I don’t know if I should keep being hopeless. I don’t know what to do seriously. So I have health issues and I will admit I have not been considering nor planning getting one of those disability forms signed for extended periods of time on work—and I believe they have other resources. 

Fyi, I’m being totally honest I did start the semester off 100% energized, ready to learn, focused, was mostly on top of assignments. Yet now I’m here and my history professor says that for her class it might be for my other history class as well, I have to get every single thing in by the fifth which is this Thursday and I literally have no idea how to get every single missing assignment I’ve had starting the rest of today in, as well as studying really hard for these test completing some study guides. I don’t think any of this is possible. 

I just don’t know what to do how to handle this. This is just too much. Is there anything I can do as an intervention to save myself? I feel like I should panhandle my excuses to my professors on email at this point. Sigh. I really do not wanna have to fail like two out of three of these classes potentially and still get a really bad grade in one of them just to repeat them. This is going to look like a total nightmare. I cannot do this. Is there a potential miracle I can bring upon myself in all of this? Am I fucked? I don’t know what to do. I do admit a lot of this is my fault, but I’m trying to get the last of what I can, to my ability, in. This is genuinely frustrating.

"Prof recommended AI for an assignment… but their syllabus bans it.","Edit: Thank you for your comments, especially those of you who were kind and heard my concerns. What I’m beginning to learn is that there is a distinction between using AI to help you understand content and using it to write your assignments for you. I still have my own reservations against using it for school, but I feel a lot better than I did when I wrote this post. Not sure how many more comments I have the energy to respond to, but I’ll keep this post up for educational purposes.

——

Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a weird situation and would love to know how others would feel or respond. For one of my university classes, we’ve been assigned to listen to a ~27-minute podcast episode and write a discussion post about it.

There’s no transcript provided, which makes it way harder for me to process the material (I have ADHD, and audio-only content can be a real barrier for me). So I emailed the prof asking if there was a transcript available or if they had any suggestions.

Instead of helping me find a transcript, they suggested using AI to generate one or to summarize the podcast. I find it bizarre that they would suggest this when their syllabus clearly states that “work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity.”

On top of that, I study media/technology and have actually looked into the risks of AI in my other courses — from inaccuracies in generated content, to environmental impact, to ethical grey areas. So I’m not comfortable using it for this, especially since:

* It might give me an unfair advantage over other students
* It contradicts the learning outcomes (like developing listening/synthesis skills)
* It feels like the prof is low-key contradicting their own policy

So… I pushed back and asked again for a transcript or non-AI alternatives. But I’m still feeling torn, should I have just used AI anyway to make things easier? Would you feel weird if a prof gave you advice that directly contradicted their syllabus?

TLDR: Prof assigned an audio-only podcast, I have ADHD, and they suggested using AI to summarize it, even though their syllabus prohibits AI use. Would you be confused or uncomfortable in this situation? How would you respond?","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l1sa4u/prof_recommended_ai_for_an_assignment_but_their/","2025-06-02 20:10:41","CollegeRant","astoriaa_"
"I get professors are human too but this is ridiculous","I’m just really frustrated with this one class. It’s a requirement for my major and the professor teaches it so bad. 

In top of that he grades assignments and tests super late. Like finals are literally next week and he finally posted the first midterm grades last week. I can’t imagine how far behind he is grading the second midterm we took. 

He even said that the first midterm will be curved if we sent it regrade requests to fix it (which I did). And it got better but now idk what’s gonna happen for the second midterm and if that’s gonna get curved too. 

He’s giving me the vibe that he’s failing this class with all the curves, last minute extra credits, dropping lowest quizzes and assignment scores, and extremely late grading.

And don’t get me started on his lectures, if the class is failing it’s because he’s got poor instructions. He repeats everything that’s on the lecture slides word for word, the lecture slides are just chunks of paragraphs and hardly summarized, and he always writes in the chalk board with chicken scratch handwriting. I could not write any notes cuz I couldn’t understand what the hell he’s writing.

Dude should not have taken this job as a teacher if he struggling this hard. Idk how to feel bad for him, cuz I NEED TO PASS THIS CLASS. I can’t drop it either, it’s my 2nd retake. It’s moments like this I hate school with a passion.","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l1p8m5/i_get_professors_are_human_too_but_this_is/","2025-06-02 18:12:54","CollegeRant","Glittering-Ad-1626"

The reason my grade is so low in English because I would procrastinate on all of my assignments until the last minute and either not complete them, or try to turn them in pass the deadline and fail because...it was past the deadline lol.

I'm extra disappointed in myself because English is easily my best subject. Whenever I would turn them assignments in, I'd score high on them! So it's not like I was struggling with the subject, I was mostly struggling with turning stuff in, due to my ADHD.

So guys, anyone else finish their first semester with a low GPA? Were you able to bring it back up and turn it around?

"Feeling like a failure post graduation","This whole semester I've struggled with OCD, but managed to finish strong academically. There were some bumps (e.g. the teacher of my favorite class accusing me and others of cheating, even though I didn't, and me crying in front of them).

This was only the first of my ""mess ups.""

I've had several interviews, and they've all gone ""meh."" But then I had one recently that went TERRIBLY.

First, my mom got mad that I applied for this position and not another one from the company. ""Of all the wonderful positions you applied to THAT one?!"" So, that left me feeling super unmotivated to actually research the company. Which I totally should've done because I couldn't answer any questions and the interviewers were clearly embarrassed for me. My legs were shaking and I actually ended up hanging up during the interview which is wildly unprofessional. I did hop back on the call after they called back, but I just felt beyond terrible. My parents are disappointed and embarrassed, too. I'm also terrified my supervisor will hear about it and ask how it went and find out and be shocked I didn't know some questions I should've known. I have no idea why I didn't prepare. I was just rattled going into it, but that is no excuse. I'm almost tempted to send an apology email.

This was a week ago. I've just lost all joy for life, and it's so hard to put on a fake happy face when seeing family. I like my parents but I just want to get a job in another state and get far, far away from here. My supervisor would be mortified and disappointed. I just want to hide away from everyone.

"I feel like in so far behind","I’m going into my senior year of college. It’s going to take me 4.5 years to graduate, so I have 1.5 years. I just feel so behind. I struggled a lot my freshmen year so my gpa wasn’t the best 2.15 gpa. I worked super hard over the past couple years and now I have a 3.05 gpa. The reason I feel super behind is because I haven’t been able to find any internships. When it comes to school I feel like I’m good, but for my future I feel behind. 

I couldn’t find an internship all of last year. I made it to a couple final rounds then didn’t get the job. So I worked hard to try and get more stuff for my resume cause it was kinda bland. I added projects on there, I joined a club, which I am a member  of the E-board now, and I’ve added a lot more skills that I think will be very useful for my degree and the jobs/internships I will be looking at in the future.  I just feel super far behind because friends of mine all have internships or they have multiple internships with more on the way and they all have stealer gpa (3.8+) while I don’t have a good gpa or any internships yet. 

They are all nice about it and don’t say anything or they say I’m on the right path to getting an internship, but I’m still struggling.

Overall has the stuff I added over the last year, being on the e-board of a club, the projects, and the skills help me better with my internship. 
My previous resume was maybe half a page worth of the stuff now I struggled to find a way to put it all on just one page. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1l0fu3v/i_feel_like_in_so_far_behind/","2025-06-01 04:03:10","CollegeRant","Italian___stallionn"

"I feel so defeated","I’m in the 3rd week of my summer semester and so far all of my classes have been amazing, besides composition. 

Not to toot my own horn or anything but I’ve always loved writing and I know I’m good at it, I’ve taken this class before and I excelled before I withdrew. (Family issue, had to drop out to become a caretaker.)

My prof this semester has been really dejecting for me, I’ve only lost like, 1 point per assignment so grades aren’t really an issue. It’s just the feedback. For our essay outlines she told us we didn’t need to be detailed with it, just a basic outline…. Her feedback to me was basically saying that I should’ve been more detailed and mentioned the article name more (that part confused me a bit but whatever I guess)

I feel like I’m playing mind games to understand what she wants us to do as I have somehow misunderstood every rubric thus far (and it’s not only me) and she doesn’t clarify when asked. I have a paper due today that I have just found myself unable to write. I know it needs to be done but I just feel like nothing I write is going to be good enough for her 🙃

I also have a lot of extra pressure this semester as I have a full tuition scholarship waiting for me in NYC, which is an amazing opportunity for me since I plan to work in the entertainment industry. If my GPA slips I could risk it but I needed more credits so… :/

"Dropped From Course","Oh boy am I livid. 

Slight context: Transferred colleges. I take summer courses (mainly math based) to balance out work load. Took Calculus I over Summer 2024 at my previous college, now I ~~am~~ *was* taking Calculus II this summer at my now college. 

Just got this lovely email today. 

""I wanted to let you know that due to failing MATH 165 you are being dropped from MATH 166 that you have enrolled into this summer.  There is not another section available to enroll into this summer unless you are interested in SPEA which I put link below."" 

Math 165 is Calculus I. I pulled up my transcript. I passed with a B. Math 166 is Calculus II. I should be in that class. 

The college I'm at now just received my updated transcript as well, so there is no denying what classes I passed. 

The only other reason I could think as to why I was dropped was because I messed up when doing the Honorlock test proctor exam. It was just setting up Honorlock and making sure you do it properly. I clicked out and it submitted the test before I did anything. I clicked out just because I thought I missed something. Nothing major, I emailed my professor explaining what happened. Never got back to me. The test wasn't graded or anything, so I figured as long as I did my first exam right, it'd be fine.

With all that being said, if it were the Honorlock test that kicked me out, that should've been stated in the email. However, it was not, thus I don't think that was the case. Just something coincidental. Bad luck. 

Anywho. Just wanted to vent. I will be calling the woman who sent the dropped course email tomorrow. I just saw it and it's after business hours. 

TL;DR: Got kicked out of a course due to administration believing I failed prerequisite.

UPDATE: Called the lady who asked for a copy of the transcript. Sent it to her, she talked to registrar, everything is sorted out and I'm back in the class!","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1kyqgzd/dropped_from_course/","2025-05-30 00:15:58","CollegeRant","BenDrewP"
"Roommate constantly sleeps","Like. Constantly. Yesterday I woke up at 8 am, she was sleeping, alright, reasonable hour to still be asleep. I studied and did whatever until like 4 pm, she woke up just once to use the bathroom during those eight hours and immediately fell back asleep. I went out to run some errands, came back about an hour later. Saw her eating (dinner? breakfast?) for a bit and the she was in her bed asleep with some tv show running on her tablet. Then I went to bed at like 3 am last night, she was asleep. Woke up at like 10 am, still asleep. Took a shower, got ready for class, went to class for 4 hours, came back. Still asleep. It was like 5.30 pm and I had to open up some mail and she woke up to the rustling of my package all grumbling and then went out to smoke. 

Like, what the fuck? You want to take a private phone call in the room? Too fucking bad. She's sleeping. Want to do your makeup? Oh no no you better not make a single tapping sound or keep your light on for too long because she'll lift her head and ask you how long are you gonna keep going for. You wanna keep your light on at like idk 8 pm, tough luck. Like goddamn. There are 4 people in the room and no divide between study/living area and the bunk beds. And it's not like this is a rare occurence. This is our normal now. I do also have a bonkers sleep schedule but I already told the girls that I don't mind it if they make noise while I'm asleep since I'm a heavy sleeper and have a schedule that might be inconvenient for others. 

I just want to not tiptoe 24/7 around my room man. Or at least maybe, MAYBE, don't get all pissy on people for trying to go about their days while you're on your 15th hour of sleeping.

I'm mot gonna stick my nose where it doesn't belong and play support for a person I barely know.

"Need Guidance on Fellowship","Hello all, First time posting here but in a bit of a quandary. I am a senior and recently got awarded a opportunity to participate in a fellowship. It's essentially a fellowship designed to help students of marginalized backgrounds (POCs, LGBTQ+, etc.) pursue careers in the Humanities. In the course of two years you are prompted to create a scholarly article that will eventually be published and presented. The course is quite rigorous with deadlines usually days apart and multiple meetings weekly with coaches, advisors, and a mentor. It sounds like a dream for someone ,like me, who wants to pursue a career in academia right ? Well here's the thing... I kind of wanna enjoy my summer. I have a job at a youth center/clinic as a Peer Health Educator and every July-August they do a summer camp for middle schoolers, I already declared that I would be available the whole summer to work and aside from that I am most likely going on a vacation mid-July. I guess this is a classic dilemma of duty vs want; I WANT to enjoy my summer, but I feel it's my DUTY to lock in and take advantage of this opportunity. I plan on going to graduate school but I'm unsure if I could even get in without this fellowship. I presume one can get into graduate school without the fellowship, but wouldn't it look better ?

"Burned out, autistic, and f**king done with the Spanish university system","I’m autistic. I spent years trying to get through a biotech degree here. Professors don’t teach — they gatekeep. One of mine passed 6 people out of 60 that were in the class. Not once. That was the usual thing that happened year after year. And when you ask for help? You get ignored or treated like a nuisance.

Moreover it's a ""catholic"" university, some profs made comments like “people born from IVF are subhuman” and to the girls “you’d be better off at home raising kids.” Literal Francisco Franco 1940s vibes. 
Misogyny and ableism. Classmates are preppy kids that bullied me as soon as noticing I was autistic. Nobody cared or ever did anything, I was on aid and they were paying so they weren't going to ""annoy the customers"".
I asked for disability accommodations. I asked again. My father even contacted the dean when I was suicidal. Nothing.  I fought to stay afloat while classmates laughed behind my back and the administration pretended it wasn’t happening.

And no, you can’t just “switch classes” or “talk to student support.” There is only one class only one curriculum and there's no support. Emails go unanswered for months. Complaints disappear into a black hole. I had a disability scholarship, and on top of everything else they STILL accused me of having debt and tried to block my enrollment just because I didn't keept bootlicking their shitty institution.

\- Rule 1 will be more specific. Posts should be about the college experience. Posts should either be about venting or asking for advice. General discussion about college or any promotional material will be removed. Posting promotional material will be a ban worthy offense.

\- Rule 2 will be more specific and more actively enforced. All comments must be supportive or respectfully constructive. Any comments that are demeaning, disrespectful, accusatory, rude, or just unhelpful and unneeded will no longer be allowed. Criticism is absolutely allowed if it's inherently constructive, nuanced, and helpful. For example, saying ""You are lazy. Grow up."" is not very constructive or useful advice at face value.

"Major is full, now graduating late","I had a pretty eventful freshman year (multiple hospitalizations, court, etc) which made my gpa go down. To be able to get into the major I want, i needed a 2.7 gpa or higher. I had failed some classes but was on the route to retake them. Since the end of 2023, I was put on contact with the new major I choose to graduate with and was told to return when I increased my gpa. This was done by my old advisor who was amazing. I was switched to a new one since I was undecided. Since then, my new advisor recommended for me to take their classes and I did as told. I was told that once I raised my gpa enough, I would transition into their program. Since last year during the fall semester, I have been emailing them since I wanted to join their program and wanted to apply immediately. That was over 6 months ago and now I just got an email saying that they are full and I cant graduate with them until 2029. They also increased their gpa requirements. 

The thing that pisses me off is that my advisor has been no luck in this whole process, she is the advisor for this program yet always seemed to think I wouldn’t make it. Always points out how surprised she is that I made it this far. She never contacted the program, instead I was the one to send emails, go in person and everything. Even doing that, I was ignored by the program director for 5 months. I was told to contact immediately which is what I did every time. I was originally going to graduate 2026 but now its looking like 2027 due to how clinicals work (from spring-fall-spring order) for my new major. If I stayed with my original major I choose since 2023, they have no graduation occupancy until 2029. 

Now my parents are absolutely pissed off and want to talk to the dean. Especially since I recorded most of the things in emails. If I was told just 5 months earlier, I could’ve changed majors smoothly and be on track for graduation. Instead I have to pick a new major, have an empty fall semester and have to take two classes in spring before clinical (these classes are only available in spring). 

I am just so confused on what to do and frustrated, i took so many winter and summer classes to be on track just for it to be for nothing. I also cant leave my university due to my scholarships. It feels like I was led on to believe something and work towards something, just for it to be taken away. The new major seems good and I am interested in it, but it feels like I gave up too. Feels like everything was for nothing. ","https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1kuit4d/major_is_full_now_graduating_late/","2025-05-24 18:47:10","CollegeRant","MainCrazy5644"

"How can I succeed as a working adult after a coddled adulthood? Follow up","This is a follow up to a now deleted post I made here yesterday (I deleted it since it never gained traction at all). For those who didn't see it, here's a TL;DR a commentor made: I’ve been severely neurologically atypical since I was a child, and was able to get through schooling through graduate level with a lot of assistance from supportive parents, educators, and other resources. This started failing where I was advised to drop out and gain life experience before continuing academically. I continued despite that and ended up flopping as a full time instructor so bad to the point I declined a full time instructor position that would've taken place this academic year. The post from yesterday has a long, third paragraph for those wondering about the specific details about how bad I've dropped the ball and how I haven't learned from my mistakes because I generally took the completely wrong lesson from whatever experience I had in this case.

I decided to look into therapists who help adults transition to be independent and I could only find one potential provider in my state (Ohio). The hourly rate at the lowest is like $350 an hour, which I cannot reasonably afford on my own. Once a month maybe, but if the demands are more than that, then I can't do that in the long run at all.

Furthermore, none of them explicitly help with the specific parts of independence that I now (yes, I'm convinced after yesterday that independence is important since my parents aren't going to be around forever) want to work on, which is mainly emotional control (e.g., stress), managing relationships (work, personal. Not romantic since I haven't dated in 7 years by choice), and self direction (my latest evaluation at 29 noted my self-direction skills are below average). Many of these therapists help with things I already know or learned in my mid to late 20s, such as paying bills, doing laundry, scheduling appointments, etc.

I guess this now means I'm officially back to my question again. This time though, how can I transition to become more independent in this case? The general trend is that, each time I've failed at something, there was always an outside resource (e.g., a coach) to help me get back on my feet again. My parents saw this as a move to ""not leave their kid behind,"" but it also meant that I did the classic autistic thing of maintaining my habits as much as I can and hardly being flexible at all.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1l98x8r/how_can_i_succeed_as_a_working_adult_after_a/","2025-06-12 00:34:33","Adulting","Aromatic_Account_698"

"When putting ""on hold"" small everyday items and piling them together before figuring out whether to keep them or throw them, what is your go-to temporary storage space in your bedroom? Baskets, file organizers, boxes???","Every year, after finally cleaning up my work table and having enough space to put miscellaneous paper, receipts, and whatnot on it, I somehow end up filling up the space with various other things I feel are important, difficult to find an appropriate storage space for, and ""something to eventually reorganize"".

But my problem that led me to ask this is the my consequent tendency of then piling things on my bed. Other than actual everyday items like keys, wallet, IDs, or cards, I end up piling up receipts, coins, random gift certificates, accessories, pens, flyers, or hell my iPad I don't always use but is good to have when needed so I can't sell it 💀

Now my post asks about your go-to temporary storage space (assuming you're just limited to your bedroom!) because I feel like I genuinely need that catch-all space for things I bring home or take out of my pocket - a space that isn't on my table or bed - even if I got my organizers in check. 

I just feel as though there are really just gonna be times where I can't devote that small attention needed to compartmentalize things into where they actually or possibly belong, so I'd rather there be a temporary space from where I can later choose what to throw or keep.

I do have a bedside table, but that also is a mess in itself and I'd like an alternative that is just entirely separate from any of my tables so I can clean my actual spaces without the hassle of moving individual piles of whatnot every time. Cabinets are an option, but I kinda want a more visible indicator of where all my  piles of random items are.

Any thoughts or personal anecdotes would be greatly appreciated!

"Sometimes feel like I don't want to get married but I do want kids. Is it realistic to think that I could have a baby out of wedlock with a successful, intelligent man? Who has done this?","I am 24 and though I have no intentions of getting into a relationship or having kids now, I keep going back and forth between marriage and no marriage. Sometimes, I think it would be possible to find the guy of my dreams, get married, and be in a good, happy marriage but I haven't dated much and it just seems like a lot of guys don't have what I am looking for. The one thing I do know is that I see myself as a mother--I would love to have a child or two. When I think of successful, well-educated people (like myself) and the kind of man I would want to have kids with, I don't think they have kids before getting married.

My dilemma is that I like my autonomy, my routine, and I don't want to be trapped financially. I have seen my parents marriage and my mom my whole life has told me how unhappy she is--she feels stuck. I feel like if I found a successful guy and was in a relationship and then we both decided to have a child and co-parent, that would be the ideal outcome. If you were in a relationship and then broke up but had a kid, is child support a part of the equation? Is that even possible? Am I crazy for looking at this as a possibility?

"What do I get my bigoted father for Father’s Day","My (22F) father (52M) is a chronically online, (borderline conspiracy theorist) Trump supporter. He was relatively moderate until the pandemic, when he became a radical far-right freak. My mom said he’s not even the same person she married. His politics are his whole personality. I’m a closeted bi non Christian, so silly democratic (though apolitical) woman. We have nothing in common, and the past few years speaking to him has really sucked, because he is more aggressive than he was in my childhood. Fortunately, I’m moving out of state, hoping to use that space to heal. With that being said, I love my father even though he has really hurt me in the past. I plan to get him a Father’s Day gift just because I hope to not see him until December. Does anyone have any recommendations?

He doesn’t care for sports, loves hunting, and is extremely athletic. It’s so hard to shop for him.

"Almost 30, Stuck in a Career I Trained For, and I Don’t Know What to Do Next","Hey everyone,

I’m turning 30 soon and I feel completely lost when it comes to my career. I spent three years in school preparing for the field I’m currently working in, passed multiple state boards, and have been waiting for my official license for over a year now. The thing is… I hate it.

Even though I’m technically doing what I studied for, the reality of the job has made me miserable. Most mornings I wake up with this pit of anxiety in my stomach — I literally feel sick knowing I have to go in. I try to push through, but it's taking a serious toll on my mental health and I mean SERIOUS. I keep thinking: *If I feel this way now, how am I supposed to do this for the rest of my life?*

At the same time, I feel like a failure for even thinking about leaving. I put so much time, money, and effort into this career path — and I haven’t even gotten my license yet. It feels like I’m throwing it all away, and that guilt is keeping me stuck.

The problem is, I don’t know what I want to do instead. I’ve tried reflecting on what I enjoy or what I’m good at, but nothing jumps out. I just know this can’t be it. I need a change, but I don’t know where to start or how to give myself permission to start over.

Has anyone else been here? Did you leave a career you spent years working toward? How did you find clarity on what to do next — or even just build the courage to walk away?

"I lost my beloved dad this March unexpectedly, I feel like a vulnerable little girl again, how do you recover from losing your parent?","I'm 35 years and lived with my parents since the day I was born. I looked after my dad, he was frail and had heart failure and diabetes. He passed away suddenly in his sleep on Saturday morning on March 22nd, just 3 months ago. I work 12 hour long shifts but some of us, including me had finished early that day. I was lucky enough to have my last dinner with my parents, we always sit down and eat together. They would even wait for me untill 9:30pm when I would come home from work eat dinner with me. That's how much love they had for me even when they are hungry. I had a talk with my dad as usual, he said the meal was delicious and few hours later he is gone. Normally there would be signs with his condition. I said my last goodbye, kissed him in the forehead and held his hand, stroked his white beard.

I'm so sad and can't stop crying, I feel so lost and lonely without my dad and feel like a vulnerable little girl again, the world feels scary and I miss the unconditional love that no one else can give me except my parent, I'm now holding onto my mum and sister as the only immediate family I have left and love very much too. I miss caring for my dad, it's the little things too preparing and collecting his medication, making tea and his favourite foods for him and having it together, helping him button up his shirt, warming his food in the microwave. I miss his loud voice, the tv being on, the landline calls my dad used to make, seeing him at home when I came back from work and asking how my day was.

"I need advice","Hi Reddit, I could really use some advice right now. I’m 19F and my boyfriend is 21M. We just had our baby 3 months ago. Neither of us is currently working, and we’re receiving CalWORKs benefits to help us get by.

I’m currently in school working toward my dental assistant certification — I have about 5 months left. My schedule is:
	•	Monday & Wednesday: In-person classes from 7:30 AM to 1:00 PM
	•	Tuesday & Thursday: Zoom for about an hour, then homework the rest of the day

Right now, we’re living with my sister, but the living situation isn’t safe or sanitary for a baby. We really need to move out, but that’s hard without an income.

My boyfriend has been trying to find work, but interviews have been tough for him. His only past job was at Amazon, where he didn’t have to interview — so now he feels lost and discouraged. I’ve tried to help him practice for interviews, but he feels like I’m criticizing him, so I haven’t been able to support him much there.

Meanwhile, I just got a job offer at a Gap warehouse. The shift is from 3:30 PM to 12:00 AM. I’m seriously torn. Between school, parenting, and this new job, I don’t know how I’ll balance it all — especially with such a young baby. But at the same time, if I don’t take the job, I’m afraid we’ll never be able to move out.

Private landlords aren’t an option — we live in a small city in California and rent is way too expensive to cover with just my cash aid, especially with diapers and bills.

I feel stuck. I want to finish school and build a future for us, but I don’t know if we can last five more months at my sister’s. My boyfriend is struggling to find work, and I feel like I’m the only one who’s been able to land job offers.

"My Grandma is pressuring me to take debt because she thinks she's right. I can't convince her unless I prove that she's wrong but Im overwhelmed.","The title makes my grandma sound more of a bad person than she is but it is whats basically happening.

Im a dependent of my grandmother. **( she was in the military )**

I took out federal loans for last spring semester and this summer semester. I originally didn't want to take all the loans this semester. The VA GI bill benefits would be low this summer but thought I could mange with the grants and the lowest loan until the fall.

My grandma convinced me otherwise; citing that with her retiring she can't take care of me and the house hold. **( even though she's getting retirement and I know how much the VA pays her and she takes half of my VA stiffen for bills.. I digress though.)**

Note that I live with my grandparents. I barely have expenses. The most expensive thing I have is uber because I can't drive yet ( **I have cerebral palsy so it's difficult )**. But she recently has been driving me because she had safety concerns. But I don't have to go anywhere because Im doing summer online. The only expense the summer loans would cover is school supplies and healthy foods, supplements, and medicine to mange my chronic pain.

To add to this my aunt got a bit mad at me off the amount of loans I took when Im in such a blessed situation . I promised I won't take anymore big loans. When I brought this up to my grandma she said that my aunt isn't taking care of me when I can't afford something and to talk about my finances to aunt.

She also added that the VA may forgive my loans but that doesnt make sense. Yes, the VA for gave her and my aunts 100k (each) debt but they both served and, unless im blind, I fail to see that for dependents.

**\* Note I went to a separate sub reddit to ask this question. They said no I wouldn't qualify and I was right but I still need proof. Like a line saying I can't qualify. I think I may have to call them...\***

I also fear that she might not realize im accruing interest right now. Did the math, by the time payments start one of my loans would have accrued about 1k for no reason. and I accepted I think the same one last semester, so that 2k gone for no reason. Then apparently the interest can have capital so I would be paying interest for my interest. Already have about 200$ of interest.

It isn't her debt. she doesnt have to pay it off if it doesnt work out.

Beyond this last semester I want to put half my money away. Out sight out of mind per se. If I needed it I could take it out. I wanted this money to go into some account so it would stack up interest. Buy the time it needs to be payed off I would already have a huge chuck and more some to start paying.

My Grandma said it was a bad idea, citing I wouldn't be able to take any money out for like 10 years or something without heavy penalties. I was not knowledgeable at the time but what I was talking about a HYS account. something I could most defiantly take some money if I need it. Instead its just lying around in her account.

\-----

Which brings us to today. When Im right I usually let her play it out to see that I was right but I literal can't afford to let this play out.

**I need proof.**

Proof that I won't get loans forgiveness. Proof that I can't let these loans sit around and acrew interest. Proof that I can be doing more with this money then let it sit.

**I have about a week** before the money transfers that when I need to have all my proof ready. I also need to talk to her about opening a bank account she doesnt have access to but thats a little scary.

**Im just so overwhelmed.**

I have a plan. Educate myself on what benefits I qualify for and finances put it all into one google doc. Call my aunt to come over while where talking so "" I don't tell her about my finances"" and she can intervene when needed. But money is sooo hard!

**Which savings account?**

**Is fizz good to build credit while in college?**

**Should I just put the money in a HYS account or should I also invest in trade?**

**How do I calculate my budget when having little and sometimes unexpected expenses?**

**Which one of these finance channels are right and I should be listening to?**

**etc.**

\----

Im also doing these things from this point on:

Taking free finical courses to stretch this loan out.

Working getting qualified for a job in my major (psych) ( haven't taken related courses till now)

Physical therapy ( to learn to drive. I see a lot of jobs want you to have reliable transportation)

Scholarships, Scholarships,Scholarships ( was lazy before but not anymore)

Setting up auto payments so it doesn't acrew interest.

"New Job - Money vs. Quality of Life","Hi all, I'm 25M, and would love some perspective from strangers on the internet here. 

I have the opportunity to take on a new role in which I'd make 20% more money and have way more opportunity for career growth. It's a complete no brainer in these regards.

My internal dilemma is that my current job is seemingly unmatched in quality of life considerations. My commute is only 25 minutes, the culture, even leadership, encourages leaving a little early when you've had a productive day/week. I value these things a lot - who wouldn't.

Moving to this other company would provide me with so many pros, but big cons being a 55 minute commute and a stricter expectation surrounding work hours.

On one hand I think, ""who the hell am I to pass up this opportunity. It would be selfish of me to not lay this foundation for my career to better support my fiance and the family we want to start when we're 30.  
On the other hand I worry, ""Do I have the mental fortitude to deal getting home from work 12-13 hours after leave? 

Final context - moving is not an option, I generally struggle with self-discipline, I want to ""be a man"" for my family.

"How important is leadership in-school?","I've been trying (applied to \~10 different clubs, attempted to start 3 clubs, applied to become a student ambassador), but all my efforts have summed to naught. How cooked am I? (I'm aiming for t20s in a competitive public hs.) I've been dealing with social anxiety, erratic behaviors, and loneliness from a young age, which explains why it's difficult for me to garner positive attention from others. I don't know how effective this would be as an excuse, though.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1l98356/how_important_is_leadership_inschool/","2025-06-11 23:54:11","ApplyingToCollege","Firm_Visit_3942"

I want to go to a small on state school with a high acceptance rate of 94% and a low gpa requirements the only issue is that i took an academic math class and almost failed itand now everything is uncertain

"dream course or dream school","Hi! Incoming freshman here trying to decide between two college options and would appreciate some advice. I was accepted into UP for a BS in Food Technology, and I may also qualify for a DOST scholarship, which would provide significant financial assistance. However, I also got into National University Clark for BS in Psychology with a full Blue Scholarship (100% free tuition and miscellaneous fees).

My true passion is psychology, and my dream is to become a psychiatrist someday. UP offers prestige and broader opportunities in science, but Food Tech isn’t something I’m truly interested in, and the DOST scholarship comes with a service obligation in a STEM-related field after graduation. On the other hand, NU Clark is closer to home, allows me to study exactly what I love, and gives me the freedom to pursue med school right after college.

Now I’m torn: Should I go for my dream course or my dream school? What would you do in my shoes?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1l95xbg/dream_course_or_dream_school/","2025-06-11 22:17:02","ApplyingToCollege","IronGlittering4126"
"Is system engineering worth it?","Hi, I'm new here and my question is (for those who know) is studying system engineering worth it? I've been thoroughly investigating this area, i mean, internet searches, form reading, contemplating on personal experiences on here, I've even talked to a few engineers myself, I've asked a lot of questions the responses I've gotten are nothing to scary yet but my primary issue here is I can't stop thinking about is how it's apparently hard to break in as a junior in the work area, that and the difficulty of the major, I have a 97GPA, not bad but im not the kind of person that's just naturally smart, I put in the work, im scared I won't be able to make it on just that down the line. In any case, is there a way for me to gain experience or be more eligible for jobs in my area when I graduate? I've been hearing things like getting certifications before graduating and doing some freelancing I can later write down as work experience, I don't want to study two engineerings to gain experience, does anyone know what I could do? Anything  would be appreciated.  (I'll be honest I'm going to study this because in my country DR it's a highly demanded major and therefore could provide me with stability and good paycheck, im not that into programming bit I heard there's not as much as I thought in the major).
Also, is it one of those engineerings where girls are unappreciated more?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1l954kg/is_system_engineering_worth_it/","2025-06-11 21:44:14","ApplyingToCollege","Visible_Life2259"

I'm an international student applying for Fall 2026 undergrad programs in the U.S., planning to major in **Economics and Business**.

I’ve built a list of 15 universities and am now looking to add 5 more that are stronger **match/safety options**, with good **ROI**, **economics/business strength**, and **support for international students** (including possible merit aid or lower cost).

"What should I be doing if I don’t plan to go to university right after I graduate?","I want to start off by saying that I myself am still learning the college process and how it works and what I need to do. My parents did not go to college here and have no idea how it works and what I need to be doing so I'm mostly figuring it out myself. My school is also a small private Christian school with no actual guidance counselor, so I have no one in that regard that I can speak to about college.

I graduate in May of 2026, but I've decided I don't want to go straight to a 4-year university/college as soon as I graduate. I decided I want to take some time (gap year of sorts?) to decide what it is I want to do and study and where it is I want to go. I'm thinking of doing community college for around 2 years and then transferring to a university.

But it's the summer before my senior year and just want to make sure I don't miss any important steps. I've taken the May SAT but my scores were not that good so I've also taken the June SAT and plan to take the August SAT. How does everything work with scores, scholarships, and other college related stuff if I'm not going to a university right after I graduate? What about applications and my college essay? Do I still need to watch out for certain deadlines? I live in Texas, if that helps with anything.

I'm sorry if I'm not giving enough information or it's too vague. I just genuinely do not know what I should be doing. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1l924sa/what_should_i_be_doing_if_i_dont_plan_to_go_to/","2025-06-11 19:43:03","ApplyingToCollege","MorningVarious8491"
"Where to go from here?","Son is a junior in competitive hs in nyc. Did good first semester taking two APs in junior year, then just seemed to burn out second semester. Skipping school, now on track to fail at least 2 classes and barely passing the other classes. He still wants to go to college but I guess it looks different now. Thankfully still looks on track to graduate on time. Prior to failing low 90s student 1500 sat minimal ecs. What schools should we consider in tri-state area? Any suggestions to handle missing recommendations? Anything else we can do in the summer or fall to still show college readiness despite temporary drop in grades?

"Family overwhelmed, kid doesn't want dorm life","Our elder will be applying for fall 26 UG. He started out with IVy dreams and then T20's in junior and has since reversed course. He has 4.0, 1480, ECs which are OK, APs, very hard working  - good enough to make it to T20 or t30.

But last couple of months - he says he doesn't want dorm life, staying with strangers and will miss home. He now wants to go to a community college till he figures it out (he is having a toughtime with major selection alos).

"International Undergraduate Applicant Seeking Guidance on Organizing Extracurricular Activities","I am a high-school student in Georgia(country), I was organizing my extracurriculars and realized that they cover a wide range of interest.  Here's what I've done so far:

1. Erasmus+ Leadership camp in Ireland (fully funded)

2. Intern at IT tech company

3. Engineering project with my father (built a small hydro project in our village, using water pressure to generate clean energy for lighting and powering home appliances for our village house)

4. Founded an English-speaking club and hosted 2 spelling-bee championships in school.

5.Volunteered in childcare center, teaching kids programming for over 6 months now.

6. Won national chess medals (1 gold, 1 silver) in amateur leagues.

7. math tutor (getting paid) 

I am also working on building school website for helping students in my school better prep for their exams. and I am expecting great scores on my exams ( 110+ TOEFL, 1500+ SAT, 4.0 UW gpa). 

so, here's my concern:

My activities seem kind of scattered; the thing is that I change interests quickly and now want to major in **engineering**. Should I do more engineering-focused activities? Do I have a real shot at top U.S. universities? Is having a part-time job a good activity?

"I don’t get it😭","I got a 770 in English but ended up with a 1490 cuz I got a 720 on Math😭  
I'm not dumb or anything I took AP calc bc and got a 5 my sophomore year, but somehow I can never get a good score for math because of 3-4 super hard questions from module 2 where I get stuck and waste like 10 minutes.

The next SAT is my last chance to take it how do I prep for math😭  
I've used resources like the collegeboard question bank but even the hardest questions on there don't even match the difficulty of the ones from the actual test

I know I need better time management strategies but I really need advice on prepping for the 3 super hard questions from module 2😭  
What can I do to improve my score??
